# XO Arena — Performance Plan

## Baseline (2026-03-28, staging)

Measured with `perf/perf.js` — 5 cold runs per page, median reported.
"Ready" = navigation start → last spinner gone (DB data visible).

| Page        | Ready  | TTFB  | FCP    |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Play        | 638ms  | 60ms  | 132ms  |
| Leaderboard | 638ms  | 58ms  | 124ms  |
| Puzzles     | 637ms  | 57ms  | 132ms  |
| Stats       | 644ms  | 59ms  | 136ms  |
| Settings    | 623ms  | 57ms  | 120ms  |
| ML Gym      | 636ms  | 62ms  | 124ms  |

**Bottleneck:** FCP is ~120ms (JS loaded, React rendered). Ready is ~625ms.
The spinner is visible for ~500ms — that is almost entirely API round-trip time
(network + backend query + DB + React re-render).

Already done: gzip compression, code splitting, 1-year asset cache,
parallel DB queries (`Promise.all`), Prisma connection pre-warming.

**Target:** Ready ≤ 300ms for all pages.

## Work Items

Work items are ordered by impact-to-effort ratio. Do them in order.

---

### Phase 1 — Backend In-Memory Response Cache

**Impact: High | Effort: Low**

Cache the results of public, infrequently-changing endpoints in a simple
in-process `Map` with a TTL. No new dependencies, no infrastructure.
When data is served from cache the API round-trip drops from ~400ms to ~5ms.

Good candidates (data changes at most every few minutes):
- `GET /api/v1/leaderboard` — top-50 list
- `GET /api/v1/bots` — active bot roster
- `GET /api/v1/puzzles` — puzzle set

Not suitable (user-specific or must be fresh):
- `/api/v1/users/:id/stats`
- `/api/v1/users/:id/games`
- Any authenticated write endpoint

**Implementation:**

1. Create `backend/src/utils/cache.js` — a minimal TTL cache utility:
   ```js
   // cache.get(key), cache.set(key, value, ttlMs), cache.invalidate(key)
   ```
2. Wrap the three route handlers to check cache before hitting the DB,
   and populate cache on miss.
3. Invalidate leaderboard and bots cache on any game completion or bot update
   (or just let it expire — 60s staleness is acceptable for these).
4. Add a cache-hit response header (`X-Cache: HIT / MISS`) for debugging.

**Expected outcome:** Leaderboard, Puzzles, Play (bot list) → Ready ≤ 200ms.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Create `backend/src/utils/cache.js` with `get`, `set`, `invalidate`
- [x] Cache `GET /api/v1/leaderboard` (TTL 60s)
- [x] Cache `GET /api/v1/bots` (TTL 60s)
- [ ] ~~Cache `GET /api/v1/puzzles` (TTL 5 min)~~ — puzzles are pure JS computation, no DB call, skipped
- [x] Add `X-Cache` header to cached responses
- [x] Invalidate leaderboard cache after a game is recorded (`POST /api/v1/games`)
- [x] Invalidate bots cache after a bot is created/updated/deleted
- [ ] Run perf benchmark and record new numbers

---

### Phase 2 — Stale-While-Revalidate on the Frontend

**Impact: High | Effort: Medium**

Persist API responses in Zustand stores (to `localStorage`). On the next
visit, show the cached data immediately (zero wait) while silently
refreshing in the background. The page feels instant on repeat visits.

Best pages to target:
- **Leaderboard** — show last-known table immediately, refresh quietly
- **Puzzles** — puzzle set rarely changes, stale data is fine
- **Play** — bot roster, available rooms list

Not suitable for user-specific data (stats, profile) where stale
data could be confusing.

**Implementation:**

1. Add a `cachedFetch` helper to `frontend/src/lib/api.js`:
   - On call: return cached value immediately if present, then re-fetch
     and update cache in the background.
   - Cache keyed by URL, stored in `localStorage` with a timestamp.
   - Max age configurable per call site (e.g. 5 min for leaderboard).
2. Update `LeaderboardPage`, `PuzzlePage`, and the bot-list fetch in
   `ModeSelection` to use `cachedFetch`.
3. Show a subtle "updated just now" indicator when a background refresh
   completes (optional, but good UX).

**Expected outcome:** Repeat visits to Leaderboard, Puzzles → Ready < 50ms.

**Checklist:**
- [x] Add `cachedFetch(url, maxAgeMs)` to `frontend/src/lib/api.js`
- [x] Apply to `LeaderboardPage` data fetch
- [ ] ~~Apply to `PuzzlePage` puzzle list fetch~~ — skipped: puzzles are random per request, showing a stale set would replay already-solved puzzles
- [x] Apply to bot list fetch in `ModeSelection`
- [x] Verify stale data is never shown on user-specific pages (stats, games, elo-history all use direct `api.get`)
- [x] Run perf benchmark (cold + warm) and record new numbers

### Phase 3 — Reduce Per-Page Network Overhead

**Impact: Medium | Effort: Low**

**Audit finding:** Play makes no HTTP API calls on mount — bots and rooms
are both lazy (fired only when the user expands a section). The original
plan to create a `/play/init` endpoint is therefore moot.

The real bottleneck for signed-in users is `api.users.sync`, which fires
on every page navigation from AppLayout. This adds a ~150ms POST request
after the auth session check resolves — one extra sequential hop per page.

Two targeted fixes:

1. **Debounce `api.users.sync`** — fire at most once per browser session
   (tracked in `sessionStorage`). Subsequent navigations skip the sync,
   removing ~150ms from signed-in user networkidle time per page load.

2. **Eager bot prefetch on Play mount** — warm the `/bots` cache in the
   background the moment Play renders. When the user clicks "Challenge a
   Bot", data is already in localStorage and appears instantly (even on a
   first visit, as long as the section is opened after the prefetch completes,
   typically within ~150ms).

**Expected outcome:** Signed-in users see ~150ms lower networkidle per page.
Bot list opens instantly on Play for all users. Cold anonymous benchmark
numbers unchanged (sync never fires for anonymous users; networkidle remains
auth-check-time + 500ms).

**Checklist:**
- [x] Audit `PlayPage` and `ModeSelection` — confirm no API calls on mount
- [x] Debounce `api.users.sync` in `AppLayout` — once per browser session via `sessionStorage`
- [x] Add eager bot prefetch in `PlayPage` on mount (`cachedFetch` background)
- [x] Run perf benchmark (cold anonymous — unchanged, as expected; see findings below)

---

### Phase 4 — Raw SQL for the Leaderboard Query

**Impact: Low-Medium | Effort: Low**

`getLeaderboard()` currently issues 4 Prisma queries: 3 `groupBy` calls
(winners, player1 counts, player2 counts) plus 1 `findMany` for user
display names. These can be replaced with a single SQL query using a CTE,
cutting 3 of the 4 round trips for this one hot path.

```sql
WITH counts AS (
  SELECT player_id, SUM(games) AS total, SUM(wins) AS wins FROM (
    SELECT player1_id AS player_id, COUNT(*) AS games,
           COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE winner_id = player1_id) AS wins
    FROM games GROUP BY player1_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT player2_id, COUNT(*), COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE winner_id = player2_id)
    FROM games WHERE player2_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY player2_id
  ) sub GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT u.id, u.display_name, u.avatar_url, u.is_bot,
       c.total, c.wins,
       ROUND(c.wins::numeric / NULLIF(c.total, 0), 4) AS win_rate
FROM counts c JOIN users u ON u.id = c.player_id
WHERE c.total >= 1
ORDER BY win_rate DESC, c.total DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Checklist:**
- [x] Rewrite `getLeaderboard()` in `userService.js` using `db.$queryRaw`
- [x] Verify output shape matches existing consumers
- [x] Add test for the raw query result shape
- [ ] Run perf benchmark and record new numbers

---

### Phase 5 — Upgrade to Prisma 7

**Impact: Medium | Effort: Medium**

Prisma 7 replaces the binary Rust query engine (a subprocess that
Node.js communicates with via IPC) with a pure TypeScript Postgres driver
that talks directly to the database over TCP. This eliminates the
IPC overhead on every query — roughly 20–50ms per round trip — and
improves cold-start behaviour.

This benefits all pages, not just specific ones.

See: https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/upgrade-guides/upgrading-versions/upgrading-to-prisma-7

**Key breaking changes to review:**
- Client initialization API changes
- Some query API differences (check release notes)
- `prisma generate` output location may change

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Read Prisma 7 migration guide
- [ ] Upgrade `prisma` and `@prisma/client` in `backend/package.json`
- [ ] Update `backend/src/lib/db.js` client initialization if needed
- [ ] Run full test suite (`npm run test --workspace=backend`)
- [ ] Deploy to staging and run perf benchmark
- [ ] Record improvement vs Phase 4 baseline

## Results Tracking

Run `cd perf && node perf.js <url> --runs=5 --json` after each phase and fill in below.

> **Note on measurement:** The original `perf.js` used `waitUntil: 'networkidle'`, which
> adds Playwright's built-in 500ms idle window after the last network request. This created
> an artificial floor of ~635ms for every page regardless of real spinner time. The script
> was fixed during Phase 3 to use `waitUntil: 'load'` + spinner appear/disappear detection.
> Columns "Baseline" through "After Ph.2" are legacy networkidle measurements; "After Ph.3"
> onward are the corrected spinner-gone measurements. The two sets are **not comparable**.

_All on staging, 5 cold anonymous runs, median._

### Phase 1 findings

Phase 1 numbers are within noise of baseline (~±5ms). The backend cache **is working** —
repeat and concurrent requests to `/leaderboard` and `/bots` now return from memory —
but it does not improve cold first-visit times because the bottleneck is not the DB query.

**Root cause identified (later, see Phase 3):** The ~635ms "Ready" time was entirely a
measurement artifact — Playwright's `networkidle` wait, not real latency.

### Phase 2 findings

Phase 2 cold numbers are within noise of Phase 1 (~±10ms). This is expected —
the benchmark always uses a fresh browser context with an empty localStorage cache,
so `cachedFetch` always misses and falls through to a normal network fetch.

**The benefit of Phase 2 is entirely on warm (repeat) visits.** On a second visit
to Leaderboard or Play, the page renders the cached data instantly (0ms wait, no
spinner), then refreshes in the background.

### Phase 3 findings

Phase 3 audit revealed that the original plan (combine Play API calls into `/play/init`)
was based on incorrect assumptions. Play makes **no HTTP API calls on mount** — bot list
and room list are both lazy (triggered by user interaction).

Phase 3 was revised to two targeted changes:
- **`api.users.sync` debounce**: eliminates a ~150ms POST per page navigation for
  signed-in users. Not visible in the anonymous cold benchmark.
- **Eager bot prefetch on Play mount**: the bot list is fetched in the background when
  Play renders. By the time the user clicks "Challenge a Bot", data is already cached.

**Benchmark fix (Phase 3):** `perf.js` was rewritten to use `waitUntil: 'load'` +
spinner appear/disappear detection. This revealed the true Ready time: **~330–345ms**
across all pages, not 635ms. The ~635ms in earlier columns was Playwright's 500ms
networkidle idle window, not real latency.

**Current state (after Ph.1–3):** Ready ≈ 325–345ms. Target is ≤300ms.
The remaining gap is FCP (~130ms) + auth check round trip (~130ms) + React re-render.
Phase 4 (raw SQL leaderboard) and Phase 5 (Prisma 7) target the auth/DB hop.

## How to Measure

After each phase, run the benchmark and record results:

```bash
# Against staging
cd perf && node perf.js https://xo-arena-staging.up.railway.app --runs=5 --json

# Against prod (after promoting)
node perf.js https://xo-arena.up.railway.app --runs=5 --json
```

Fill in the tables above from the output summary.

## Not Doing (and Why)

| Option | Reason skipped |
|--------|---------------|
| **Drizzle** | Similar gain to Prisma 7 but requires rewriting ~200 queries. Not worth it. |
| **Redis / external cache** | Adds cost and ops overhead. In-process cache (Phase 1) gets 90% of the benefit at zero cost. |
| **PgBouncer** | Railway-managed Postgres already has a connection limit; adding a pooler adds latency for short queries. Prisma 7's driver is a better solution. |
| **CDN / edge caching** | Cost and admin complexity ruled out by user. |
| **SSR** | Major architectural change. Not appropriate at this stage. |
