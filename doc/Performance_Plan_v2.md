# XO Arena — Performance Plan v2

v1 lives at `doc/archive/Performance_Plan.md` and is closed out (17 phases,
Ready ~330ms floor on the small surface set that existed at the time).

This v2 is a fresh pass against the *current* platform: Fly.io hosting, four
services (backend / landing / tournament / packages), SSE+POST realtime,
Tables-as-primitive, Multi-Skill Bots (Phase 3.8), the Intelligent Guide
journey, and a mobile UI. v1's numbers and assumptions are stale; this plan
re-baselines first and prescribes fixes second.

Goal: bear down on real *and* perceived performance across **every** user-
facing surface — desktop and mobile, cold and warm, anonymous and signed-in,
free play and tournament play.

## Top 5 — what to focus on next

The five highest-impact items in the active queue, real or perceived,
sorted by (impact × user reach) ÷ effort. Updated 2026-05-05 after the
F11 warm-cache baseline.

| # | What                                | Effort | Risk   | Impact (measured / estimated)                                            | Cohort      |
|--:|-------------------------------------|:------:|:------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
| 1 | **Phase 1** — bundle splitting + per-route lazy load | 3-5d   | medium | mobile cold FCP 1416 → ~700 ms (−50%); warm parse 370 → ~250 ms          | first-time  |
| 2 | **Phase 20** — Service Worker app shell | 2-3d   | medium | warm Ready 370 ms → ~50-100 ms (−78%) — instant repeat visits            | returning   |
| 3 | **SWR + hover prefetch** for data pages (Tables / Tournaments / Leaderboard) | 1-2d | low | data spinner gone on revisit; instant render of stale + bg revalidate    | both        |
| 4 | ~~**Phase 1c**~~ ✅ shipped — sync dedupe in `landing/src/lib/api.js` | 0.5d shipped | low | cold-authed Ready 200 → 143 ms p50 (−30%) on every signed-in first paint | first-time + auth |
| 5 | **Phase 17** — CI bundle-size guard (≥ 5% chunk growth fails the PR) | 0.5d   | none   | meta — locks in #1's gains, prevents regression                          | all         |

Sequencing notes:

- **Items 1 + 2 are independent** — Phase 1 helps first-time visitors, SW helps returning users. Both are Tier 0; ship in parallel by different sessions or back-to-back.
- **Item 3 stacks on top of either** — works alone, doubles down with #2.
- **Item 5 is gated on item 1 landing** — no point in a CI guard before the splits exist.
- **F11.5 (RUM cohort segmentation) instruments the question of whether #1 or #2 hits more users**; until it lands enough data, sequencing #1 vs #2 is gut-feel.

Deferred / not on the top 5:

- F9.2 (VM CPU bump) — probe-validated as the right perf lever for backend-CPU contention but ~+$87/mo; revisit when traffic justifies.
- Sign-in async UX expansion to SettingsPage / ResetPasswordPage — perceived-perf, ~10-20 min each but low traffic.
- Phase 5 remaining steady-state SSE work — apply.post is ≤2 ms p95 at c=50, so the floor is fine.

See "Roadmap at a glance" below for the full shipped / active / deferred picture, and §F11 for the warm-cache evidence behind this ranking.

## Targets (binding budgets)

Every page on Fly prod, p75 over a 7-day RUM window:

| Metric                 | Desktop  | Mobile (4G mid-range) |
|------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| FCP                    | ≤ 100ms  | ≤ 250ms                |
| Ready (spinner gone)   | ≤ 200ms  | ≤ 500ms                |
| LCP                    | ≤ 200ms  | ≤ 500ms                |
| INP (interaction p75)  | ≤ 100ms  | ≤ 200ms                |
| TTFB (HTML)            | ≤ 60ms   | ≤ 150ms                |

Backend p95 budgets (per endpoint, single-region):

| Endpoint family                          | p95     |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `GET /bots`, `/leaderboard`, `/puzzles`  | ≤ 30ms  |
| `GET /tournaments`, `/tournaments/:id`   | ≤ 100ms |
| `GET /users/*` (stats, history)          | ≤ 80ms  |
| `POST /rt/tables` (create)               | ≤ 120ms |
| `POST /rt/tables/:slug/move`             | ≤ 60ms  |
| SSE channel join → first event           | ≤ 80ms  |

Bundle budgets per route:

- Initial parse on `/`: ≤ 120 KB gz JS, ≤ 20 KB CSS
- Largest other route: ≤ +60 KB gz over baseline
- Hero image: ≤ 200 KB on mobile (~~today: 888 KB~~ → **shipped 2026-05-05 at 50 KB mobile / 174 KB desktop** via responsive WebP, see Phase 3)

If a phase's measured win doesn't move at least one budgeted metric, mark it
*landed but ineffective* and revisit the assumption.

## Roadmap at a glance (2026-05-05)

The single table that says what's shipped, what's queued, and what's
deferred — with measured impact, cost, and risk for each major item.
Sorted by **(real ms saved × user reach)**. See per-phase sections
below for the full design / step list, and Appendix Z for completed-
work narratives.

### Shipped (2026-05-05)

| Item                                | Real impact (measured)                                     | Cost  | Risk | Where it landed |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|
| Phase 5.1 — Cold-broker XREAD fix   | publishToPickup p95 **740 → 126 ms** at c=5 (−83%); cold first-move p50 **382 → 39 ms** (−90%) | 1h    | none | v1.4.0-alpha-4.3 |
| F9.1 — pg.Pool max 10 → 30          | apply p95 unchanged at this load — no measurable gain yet (still 45-46ms at c=25); pool was not the actual bottleneck | 1h    | none | v1.4.0-alpha-4.3 |
| Phase 1d — Instant-ready hero       | mobile FCP **1416 → 432 ms** (−69%), mobile LCP **1792 → 432 ms** (−76%), desktop FCP **804 → 424 ms** (−47%) | 1d    | low  | v1.4.0-alpha-4.2 |
| Phase 3 — Responsive WebP hero      | mobile img bytes **888 → 50 KB** (−94%); mobile TBT 62 → 50 ms | 1d    | none | v1.4.0-alpha-4.1 |
| F4 — SSE round-trip decomposition (Server-Timing + `_t` breadcrumbs) | enabled the load-test analysis that found the cold-broker bug | 0.5d  | none | v1.4.0-alpha-3.0 |
| `perf-sse-load.js` — concurrent harness | closes F8 gap #3 (live SSE under load); proved publishToPickup is wakeup-bound, not load-bound | 0.5d  | none | v1.4.0-alpha-4.3 |

### Active queue — Tier 0 (next sprints)

**Cohort-aware sequencing (added 2026-05-05 after F11):** the
warm-cache baseline showed returning-user mobile Ready already
~370 ms vs cold-anon ~2050 ms. **Phase 1 is a first-time-visitor
win**; the returning-user equivalent is **SW + SWR caching**.
Both belong in Tier 0 with sequencing decided by which user pain
we hit first.

| Rank | Item                                | Real impact (measured / estimated)                         | Cost   | Risk    | Cohort | Status |
|-----:|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|
|    1 | **Phase 1** — bundle splitting + per-route lazy load | mobile FCP cold ~1400 → ~700 ms; warm parse ~370 → ~250 ms | 3-5d   | medium  | first-time | queued |
|    2 | **Phase 20** — Service Worker app shell | warm Ready 370 ms → ~50-100 ms (paint-only floor)        | 2-3d   | medium  | returning | **promoted from Tier 3** |
|    3 | **SWR data caching + hover prefetch** (new — see §F11.4) | data pages: spinner-while-fetch → instant stale + bg revalidate | 1-2d | low | returning | filed |
|    4 | **Phase 17** — per-PR perf gates    | locks in Phase 1 win; meta — direct ms = 0                 | 0.5d   | none    | meta | sequenced after Phase 1 |
|    5 | **Phase 1c** — cold-authed orchestration (sync dedupe) | cold-authed Ready ~−30%                                | 1d     | low     | first-time | queued |

(Phase 5 remaining steps demoted from Tier 0 — F9 probe sweep
2026-05-05 showed `apply.post` ≤2ms p95 at c=50, so in-process
fanout / broker shortcut is not where wall-clock lives. See §F9
and Appendix Z.1.9.)

(F9.2 — VM CPU bump — **deferred 2026-05-05 on cost grounds.** The
F9 probes proved it's the right perf lever, but performance-2x VMs
add ~$87/mo across staging + prod. Revisit when traffic justifies
it (sustained c≥25 in production telemetry) or when Fly's pricing
changes. Until then, c≤25 staging perf is "good enough" — apply
p95 26ms, movePostAck p50 ~220ms.)

### Active queue — Tier 1 (after Tier 0 lands)

| Item                                | Real impact (estimated)                                    | Cost   | Risk    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|:-------:|
| Phase 13 — TournamentDetail refactor | heaviest single surface, 1900-line render path           | 2-3d   | medium  |
| Phase 7 — mobile-specific (font preload, touch responsiveness) | mobile FCP/INP polish                              | 1-2d   | low     |
| Phase 8 — skeletons everywhere      | perceived-only, but high yield on engaged routes           | 1d     | none    |
| Better Auth allow-list trim         | cold-authed Ready −80-150 ms                               | 0.5d   | low     |
| Phase 5 — remaining steady-state SSE (Nagle, coalesce, Redis hop) | publishToPickup p50 17-21ms — modest, only if F9.2 underwhelms | 1-2d | low |

### Deferred / out-of-scope until evidence changes

| Item                                | Why deferred                                               | Re-promote when |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Phase 2 — DB indexes                | F9 audit found no missing indexes; query time <20 ms p95   | Apply p95 stays >50 ms after F9.2 |
| Phase 6 — backend cold start        | Fly auto-stop disabled in iad; not the bottleneck          | If we re-enable auto-stop |
| Phase 14 — Gym worker thread        | Non-realtime; lower user-reach than Tier 0 items           | After Tier 0 ships |
| **F9.2 — VM CPU bump** (1 shared → 2 dedicated) | Probe-validated as the right lever, but ~+$87/mo across staging + prod for performance-2x. Current c≤25 staging perf "good enough" (apply p95 26 ms, movePostAck p50 ~220 ms). | Sustained c≥25 in prod telemetry, or pricing change |
| Section E aggressive bets (Bun, WebTransport, Hono edge, RSC) | Tier 4 architecture; revisit only if Tier 0+1+2 leaves a gap | Post-V1 |

### Headline answer (was open, settled 2026-05-05)

**The F9 probes (granular `apply` Server-Timing + live pool stats)
ran on staging 2026-05-05 and gave a definitive read:**

- **`pool.waiting = 0` at every concurrency level (1 → 50).** Pool
  max=30, peak total observed = 9. Pool was *never* the bottleneck;
  F9.1 retroactively confirmed as a no-op for perf (kept as free
  hedge for c≥100).
- **`apply.find` ≈ `apply.update`** at every level — both grow
  proportionally. JSONB write contention was a weaker hypothesis
  than expected; read latency grows the same way.
- **`apply.post` ≤ 2 ms p95 at every level** — broker dispatch +
  io.emit + appendToStream is *not* contention. Phase 5 in-process
  fanout step can be **deferred** with high confidence.
- **`movePostAck` p50 grows 163 → 302 ms** at c=1 → c=50, but
  `apply` p50 only 8 → 15 ms. Apply is just 5% of the ack at c=50.
  The other ~290 ms growth lives **outside `applyMove`** — Express
  middleware, auth, lookupTableForCaller, JSON parse, network. That
  is the **1-shared-vCPU saturation profile.**

**Conclusion:** F9.2 (VM bump 1 shared → 2 dedicated) is the
**right next perf lever** with hard data behind it (predicted:
`movePostAck` p50 at c=50 drops 302 → ~150-180 ms). **Deferred
2026-05-05 on cost grounds** (~+$87/mo across staging + prod for
performance-2x VMs). Current c≤25 staging perf is "good enough"
(apply p95 26 ms, movePostAck p50 ~220 ms). Revisit when traffic
sustains c≥25 in production telemetry, or when Fly's pricing
shifts. The instrumentation stays — when we *do* re-test, the
probes already wired in v1.4.0-alpha-4.4 will produce a clean
before/after.

See §F9 for the full audit and Appendix Z.1.9 for the staging probe
sweep narrative.

## Current baseline (2026-05-02 staging, cold-anon)

Full numbers + caveats: `doc/Performance_Snapshot_2026-05-02.md`. The
single-pass median across 13 routes:

| Metric           | Target (desktop) | Measured | Over by |
|------------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| FCP              | ≤ 100ms          | ~525ms   | 5.3×    |
| LCP              | ≤ 200ms          | ~640ms   | 3.2×    |
| Ready            | ≤ 200ms          | ~760ms   | 3.8×    |

| Metric           | Target (mobile)  | Measured | Over by |
|------------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| FCP              | ≤ 250ms          | ~1360ms  | 5.4×    |
| LCP              | ≤ 500ms          | ~1450ms  | 2.9×    |
| Ready            | ≤ 500ms          | ~1580ms  | 3.2×    |

**Every route is over budget on both devices.** Three load-bearing facts
from the snapshot drive the priorities below:

1. **One bundle, every page.** First-paint JS is ~493 KB gz on every
   route (`vendor-react` 82 KB + `main.supported` 411 KB). The
   `main.supported` chunk is **1,529 KB raw / 411 KB gzip** and contains
   the entire app — no per-route lazy splitting at the page level today.
   FCP / LCP / Ready collapse to within ~100ms of each other on every
   route, the fingerprint of a single bundle blocking the first paint.
2. **PlayVsBot is genuinely 600–700ms slower than the next-worst route**
   on both devices (10-run confirmation). Not noise. The `/play?action=
   vs-community-bot` path runs sequential: `getCommunityBot()` →
   `/api/v1/rt/tables` POST → redirect, all before the spinner clears.
3. **Image bytes were not counted.** `colosseum-bg.jpg` (888 KB) didn't
   appear in the static byte total — likely loads async after Ready
   resolves. Need to confirm before promoting Phase 3.

**The data does not support** chasing DB indexes (Phase 2), SSE latency
(Phase 5), or cross-service hops (Phase 4) yet — the bundle + parse
floor is currently dominating everything else by a ~10× margin. Those
phases stay in the plan but move to Tier 2.

---

## Prod sanity-check baseline (2026-05-04)

To confirm staging is a usable proxy for prod, ran `perf-v2.js` against
`xo-landing-prod.fly.dev` (`--target=prod --warmup`, 5 runs × 13 routes ×
desktop+mobile, cold-anon), then immediately re-ran against
`xo-landing-staging.fly.dev` to remove staleness from the comparison.

Saved at:

- `perf/baselines/perf-prod-2026-05-04T10-49-09-639Z.json`
- `perf/baselines/perf-staging-2026-05-04T10-55-42-186Z.json`

**Headline:** prod ≈ staging within run-to-run noise. Staging is a
usable proxy.

| Device  | Mean Δ% (prod − staging, ready p50) | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------------:|-------|
| Desktop | **+8.6%** (n=13)                    | Two routes prod-faster (Stats −8%); rest +2 to +19% |
| Mobile  | **−0.1%** (n=13)                    | Spar prod-faster by 15%; everything else within ±5% |

Per-route ready-p50 (ms), prod vs same-day staging:

| Route        | Desktop prod | Desktop stg | Δ%   | Mobile prod | Mobile stg | Δ%   |
|--------------|-------------:|------------:|-----:|------------:|-----------:|-----:|
| Home         |          985 |         878 | +12% |        2077 |       2036 |  +2% |
| Play         |          969 |         849 | +14% |        2051 |       2046 |  +0% |
| PlayVsBot    |         1490 |        1421 |  +5% |        2061 |       2055 |  +0% |
| Leaderboard  |          968 |         811 | +19% |        2076 |       2053 |  +1% |
| Puzzles      |          850 |         796 |  +7% |        2127 |       2051 |  +4% |
| Tournaments  |          906 |         767 | +18% |        2069 |       2059 |  +0% |
| Tables       |          977 |         883 | +11% |        2085 |       2038 |  +2% |
| Spar         |          860 |         837 |  +3% |        1714 |       2012 | −15% |
| Stats        |          843 |         918 |  −8% |        2046 |       2053 |  −0% |
| Profile      |          913 |         811 | +13% |        2110 |       2052 |  +3% |
| ProfileBots  |          901 |         830 |  +9% |        2055 |       2037 |  +1% |
| Gym          |          860 |         846 |  +2% |        2059 |       2077 |  −1% |

> **Earlier draft of this section reported +23%** because the staging
> comparison was a 2-day-old baseline (2026-05-02) — staging machines had
> been warm during that earlier sweep. A same-clock comparison shows
> mobile is essentially identical and desktop is within first-route
> cold-start variance. Lesson for the playbook: **always run both
> environments back-to-back** when comparing.

### What this means for the plan

- **Staging is a valid proxy for prod.** Optimizations that move staging
  numbers will move prod numbers by approximately the same amount.
  Phase 1/1b acceptance can be measured on staging alone going forward;
  re-baseline prod once per Tier (not per phase) for confirmation.
- **The bundle + parse floor still dominates on prod.** Same JS weight
  (490 KB), same FCP/LCP/Ready collapse pattern. Phase 1 (per-route
  splitting) is still the right next move.
- **PlayVsBot tax is environment-independent.** Both prod and staging
  show PlayVsBot ~600ms above the rest at desktop p50. Phase 1b's
  sequential-init flattening applies equally to both.
- **One outlier still worth investigating:** Tournaments desktop p95 hit
  6448ms on staging (single run) and 3543ms on prod's earlier run — a
  cold backend machine handling the first `/api/tournaments` request.
  `--warmup` only HEADs landing. *Fix:* extend `--warmup` to also hit
  `/api/version` on backend and `/api/tournaments` on tournament before
  measuring. File against Phase 6 (cold-start).

### Follow-ups still open

- Run a one-off `Home × 5` against `aiarena.callidity.com` to confirm
  custom-domain TLS does not add measurable latency.
- Re-baseline prod after the next Tier-0 phase lands to confirm the
  staging-as-proxy assumption holds as the bundle gets smaller.

## Pre-flight — before running Phase 0

Cold benchmark numbers are only meaningful if the environment is real and the
data is representative. Run this checklist before every measurement pass.

### Environment up

All three Fly apps + the staging DB must be reachable:

```bash
fly status -a xo-backend-staging \
  && fly status -a xo-landing-staging \
  && fly status -a xo-tournament-staging
curl -sf https://xo-backend-staging.fly.dev/api/version && echo OK
curl -sf https://xo-tournament-staging.fly.dev/api/health && echo OK
curl -sfI https://xo-landing-staging.fly.dev/ | head -1
```

### Warm the machines (don't measure cold-start as cold-page)

Fly auto-suspends idle staging machines. The first request after suspend
includes a multi-second machine boot — that's a *cold-start* number, not a
cold-page number, and it'll skew every percentile. Two options:

- **Recommended for a benchmark window:** disable auto-suspend on each app for
  the duration of the run, then re-enable.
  ```bash
  for app in xo-backend-staging xo-landing-staging xo-tournament-staging; do
    fly scale count 1 --max-per-region=1 -a "$app"  # ensure 1 machine running
    # disable auto_stop_machines in fly.toml or use the API; revert after
  done
  ```
- **Or:** discard the first run of each route in the script (the warmup pass
  is built into `perf/perf.js` Phase 0.1 work).

### Test data shape

Heavy pages need representative rows. Staging may be sparse. Before the run,
seed (or confirm) at least:

- One in-progress 32-participant cup (for `TournamentDetailPage` worst-case).
- One user with 5+ bots, at least 2 of which have a trained ML skill (for
  `/profile?section=bots` and `/gym` heavy paths).
- ≥ 50 leaderboard entries with a mix of bots + humans (for `/leaderboard`
  disambiguation render cost).
- ≥ 1 active table (`/tables` list) and 1 spectator-joinable table.

If the data isn't there, document it in the snapshot — *don't pretend the
numbers reflect prod-shape*.

### Auth

`cold-signed-in` and `warm-signed-in` runs need a working test account on
staging:

```bash
# Required env vars (same ones e2e/qa.mjs uses):
echo "$TEST_USER_EMAIL"   # must resolve
echo "$TEST_USER_PASSWORD"

# Smoke the login flow once before the benchmark:
cd e2e && BASE_URL=https://xo-landing-staging.fly.dev npx playwright test smoke --project=chromium
```

### Quiesce other traffic

If anyone else is QAing on staging during the run, the numbers are noise.
Coordinate a window or run after-hours.

### Snapshot the build

Capture the staging git SHA so the snapshot is reproducible:

```bash
curl -s https://xo-backend-staging.fly.dev/api/version  # logs commit + version
```

Record it at the top of `Performance_Snapshot_<date>.md`.

---

## Post-flight — clean up after the run

Every change made for the benchmark must be reverted, or the next person to
hit staging gets a polluted environment (cost from pinned machines, polluted
metrics from seed data, locked test users, etc.). Run this checklist *every*
time, immediately after the snapshot is captured.

### Restore Fly machine policy

If you disabled auto-suspend for the warm pass, put it back:

```bash
for app in xo-backend-staging xo-landing-staging xo-tournament-staging; do
  # Either revert fly.toml + redeploy, or use the API to flip
  # auto_stop_machines back to "stop". Confirm via:
  fly status -a "$app"   # machines should return to suspended on idle
done
```

If you scaled machine count up, scale back down.

### Remove seeded benchmark data

Anything created *for the benchmark* must be deleted. The `um` CLI is the
canonical path so cascades fire correctly (TournamentParticipant rows get
cleaned up before User delete, etc.):

```bash
# Test cup created for TournamentDetailPage worst-case
docker compose exec -T backend node --experimental-transform-types --no-warnings \
  src/cli/um.js tournament:delete <cup-id>

# Bots minted for the heavy /profile + /gym runs
docker compose exec -T backend node --experimental-transform-types --no-warnings \
  src/cli/um.js bot:delete <botId>   # repeat per seeded bot

# Throwaway users (anything tagged isTestUser:true that isn't the persistent
# QA account) — confirm before bulk delete
```

If a Phase 0 helper script seeded the data, it should ship with a paired
`--cleanup` flag so the teardown is one command, not a manual list.

### Reset RUM ingest

Phase 0.2 wires `web-vitals` → `POST /api/v1/rum`. The benchmark's synthetic
runs will dump hundreds of fake samples into `RumSample` and skew the next
day's percentiles. Either:

- Tag every benchmark sample with `source: 'synthetic-baseline'` and exclude
  it from RUM dashboards by default; or
- Delete the rows the run produced:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM "RumSample"
  WHERE "createdAt" >= '<run-start-ts>'
    AND "createdAt" <= '<run-end-ts>';
  ```

Same logic for backend RED metrics if they're persisted (Prometheus scrapes
are ephemeral, so usually nothing to do there).

### Restore CI / config drift

If you flipped any flag or env var on staging for the run (e.g. enabled extra
logging, raised a cache TTL to test something, turned off a feature gate),
revert before walking away. List them in the snapshot doc so nothing's
forgotten.

### Sanity check

One last pass to confirm staging is back to its normal shape:

```bash
fly status -a xo-backend-staging              # auto_stop policy normal
curl -s https://xo-backend-staging.fly.dev/api/version | grep -i version
docker compose exec -T backend node --experimental-transform-types --no-warnings \
  src/cli/um.js list --filter=isTestUser     # only persistent QA rows remain
```

Smoke the e2e suite once to confirm nothing regressed during cleanup:

```bash
cd e2e && BASE_URL=https://xo-landing-staging.fly.dev npx playwright test smoke --project=chromium
```

If anything fails, the snapshot is suspect — re-run after fixing.

---

## Phase 0 — Re-baseline

v1's `perf/perf.js` ran 6 pages on Railway with 2 services. We now have
~20 routable surfaces on Fly with 4 services and a totally different
realtime stack.

### 0.1 Synthetic baseline (Playwright)  *(done — 2026-05-02)*

Shipped in `perf/perf-v2.js`. First baseline captured against staging on
2026-05-02 — 130 measurements (13 routes × 2 device profiles × 5 runs)
written to `perf/baselines/perf-staging-2026-05-02T*.json`. Analysis in
`doc/Performance_Snapshot_2026-05-02.md`.

- [x] Extend `perf/perf.js` to cover the full route inventory.
- [x] Two device profiles: desktop (1280×800, broadband) + mobile
      (Moto G4 / 4G via CDP throttling).
- [x] Run against `xo-*-staging.fly.dev`. 5 runs each, p50 + p95.
- [x] Capture: TTFB, FCP, LCP, Ready, JS bytes, image bytes, requests.
- [x] Persist results into `perf/baselines/<env>-<ts>.json`.
- [ ] **Open follow-ups** — these are real gaps, *not* blockers for
      Phase 1; tackle when their inputs become available:
  - [ ] Wire `cold-signed-in` and `warm-signed-in` contexts (needs
        `TEST_USER_EMAIL` + `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` in env).
  - [ ] Run against `xo-*-prod.fly.dev` once Phase 3.8 is promoted.
  - [ ] Re-run on staging once it bumps past `1.3.0-alpha-8.0` so
        Sprint 3.8.B + 3.8.C are reflected.
  - [ ] Add INP measurement (one scripted interaction per page —
        open modal / click row / submit form).
  - [ ] Disable Fly auto-suspend on staging for the run, seed the
        four representative-data fixtures from the Pre-flight section.

### 0.2 RUM (real-user monitoring)  *(not started — Tier 1)*

- [ ] Wire `web-vitals` into the landing app — POST `{ metric, value, route, deviceClass }`
      to a new `POST /api/v1/rum` endpoint with sampling (10% in prod, 100% in staging).
- [ ] Server stores into `RumSample` table (route, metric, value, percentile bucket,
      timestamp, country/region). Add Prisma model + migration.
- [ ] Admin dashboard panel: per-route p50/p75/p95 over 24h / 7d. (Reuse the
      existing admin metrics scaffold.)
- [ ] Define alert: any route's p75 Ready > 1.5× target for 30min → Slack.

### 0.3 Backend RED metrics (Rate / Errors / Duration)  *(not started — Tier 2)*

- [ ] Add request-duration histogram middleware in `backend/src/index.js` and
      `tournament/src/index.js`. Bucket per route + status.
- [ ] Expose `/metrics` (Prometheus text format) — Fly already supports scraping.
- [ ] Backfill the Observability dashboard (`doc/Observability_Plan.md`) with
      p95 panels per endpoint family.
- [ ] Confirm SSE channel join + dispatch latency are instrumented (the
      realtime postmortem mentions per-channel timing — verify it lights up
      Grafana).

### 0.4 Targeted gap measurements (2026-05-04 / 05) *(done — see Appendix Z.1)*

The 0.1 baseline left four open questions. New scripts plug each one:
`perf/perf-inp.js`, `perf/perf-sse-rtt.js`, `perf/perf-backend-p95.js`,
and `perf-v2.js --extended-resources`.

**Headline findings** (full tables and details in **Appendix Z.1**):

- **INP** under 32 ms p50 across every measured route on both desktop
  and mobile — *not a problem today*. (Z.1.1)
- **SSE round-trip** ~577 ms p50 prod is the perceived-perf bottleneck
  on every move; long pole is Fly Upstash pub/sub. Drives **Phase 5**
  in Tier 0. (Z.1.2)
- **Multi-machine routing bug** found and fixed via Fly-Replay
  (commit `0771718`) — 18/20 → 0/20 SSE failures on prod. (Z.1.3)
- **Prod re-baseline 2026-05-05** — backend p95 healthy across the
  board; the two genuinely load-bearing items are the JS bundle and
  the (then-) 888 KB hero image. (Z.1.4 / Z.1.5)
- **Hero image** identified as the second-biggest single-byte cost
  after JS — **Phase 3 shipped** with responsive WebP, mobile cuts
  888 KB → 50 KB (−94%). (Z.1.6)


**Deliverable:** a single `Performance_Snapshot_<date>.md` checked in next to
this plan, showing where every route currently sits vs the targets above.
*Every subsequent phase compares against this baseline.*

## Section A — Real performance

Phases that move the actual latency floor (server time, network, parse,
render). Ordered by expected impact-to-effort.

### Phase 1 — Bundle audit + per-route splitting  *(Tier 0 — start here)*

The 2026-05-02 visualizer pass (run `VISUALIZE=1 npx vite build` in
`landing/`) showed `main.supported-*.js` at **1,529 KB raw / 411 KB gz**
holding the entire app. Only `vendor-react`, `game-xo`, `game-pong`, and
the Gym sub-tabs are split out — every page component is in `main`. Per-
route splitting is the highest-leverage fix in the entire plan; until
this lands, every other phase is a rounding error.

Concrete sub-steps (in order):

- [ ] **Per-route `React.lazy()` for every page in `App.jsx`.** PlayPage,
      GymPage, TournamentDetailPage, TournamentsPage, ProfilePage,
      BotProfilePage, PublicProfilePage, RankingsPage, StatsPage,
      SettingsPage, TablesPage, TableDetailPage, SparPage, PuzzlePage,
      plus all `/admin/*` pages. Wrap each `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton/>}>`
      so the skeleton already aligns with Phase 8 work.
- [ ] **Vendor-split `@xo-arena/*`** in `manualChunks` —
      `xo`, `nav`, `ai`, `sdk`. They're currently bundled into
      `main.supported`. Promote each to its own chunk.
- [ ] **Audit Better Auth client.** Likely a meaningful chunk
      (auth-client + better-fetch + zod). If the auth flow is only
      relevant after a sign-in trigger, lazy-load the client module.
- [ ] **Audit `recharts`.** Only used in Gym Analytics + Stats.
      Confirm `vendor-charts` chunk separation; if it's leaking into
      `main`, fix the import boundary.
- [ ] **Audit ML engines (`@xo-arena/ai`).** Q-learning / DQN / AlphaZero
      should only load on Gym Train tab — already lazy at the tab level,
      but verify the engines aren't statically imported elsewhere.
- [ ] **Audit images / SVG / icons.** Anything imported as a JS module
      should be inspected; large inline SVGs should move to `<img>` or
      a sprite sheet (currently inline JSX SVGs ship inside the JS chunk).
- [ ] **Tactical library swaps.** Each of these has a measured-bytes
      payoff; do them as separate PRs so each can be validated:
  - `recharts` → `uplot` (~20× smaller, only used in Gym Analytics + Stats).
  - Audit `dayjs` boundary; nothing should pull `moment`, `luxon`, etc.
  - Subset `lodash` imports (`lodash-es/get`, not `lodash`); remove `lodash` if any path still uses it.
  - Audit `zod` boundary — only use on validators that actually run client-side.
- [ ] **Tree-shake hygiene.** Mark `sideEffects: false` on every
      internal `@xo-arena/*` package so unused exports drop. Audit
      duplicate deps (`npm ls react`, `npm ls zustand`).
- [ ] **Brotli at the edge.** Confirm Fly is serving Brotli, not just
      gzip — usually 15–20% smaller wire bytes for free.
- [ ] **Aggressive minifier.** Compare `esbuild` vs `swc` vs `terser`
      passes on `main.supported`. Cumulative ~5–10% gain typical.
- [ ] *(Optional / longshot)* Preact compat alias — saves ~50 KB gz over
      React 18, but Better Auth + react-router compat needs verification.
      Land last, behind a feature flag.
- [ ] Generate updated visualizer report; commit at
      `perf/baselines/bundle-<date>.html` for diffing.
- [ ] Re-run `perf-v2.js` against staging — confirm `main` < 200 KB gz,
      per-route chunks 30–80 KB gz, and FCP / Ready drop on every page.
- [ ] **CI bundle-size guard.** Fail PR if any chunk grows > 5% over
      `main` without a `perf-ok` label. (`size-limit` or hand-rolled.)

**Expected outcome (data-driven hypothesis):**
- `main` chunk: 411 KB gz → ≤ 200 KB gz
- First-paint JS: 493 KB gz → ~280 KB gz on Home, lower per-route
- Mobile FCP: 1360ms → ~700ms (parse cost cut roughly proportional to
  byte cut on Moto G4 CPU)
- Desktop Ready: 760ms → ~400ms

If the second perf-v2 run does *not* show these moves, Phase 1 is
*landed but ineffective* and we go back to the visualizer to find what
else is stuck in `main`.

### Phase 1d — Instant-ready hero  *(shipped 2026-05-05)*

Inlined a static tic-tac-toe board + `<h1>AI Arena</h1>` in
`landing/index.html`'s `<div id="root">`. Renders the moment HTML
lands; React's `createRoot.render()` clears the placeholder on
mount.

**Measured impact** (staging v1.4.0-alpha-4.2):

- Mobile FCP **1416 → 432 ms (−69%)**
- Mobile LCP **1792 → 432 ms (−76%)**
- Desktop FCP **804 → 424 ms (−47%)**

No bundle parse happens earlier — Ready is unchanged — but the
visible "page is alive" moment now lands at the HTML-render
boundary. Cost: 1 day; no risks materialised.

### Phase 1b — PlayVsBot deep-dive  *(Tier 0, immediate after Phase 1)*

The 10-run confirmation showed `/play?action=vs-community-bot` is
600–700ms slower than the next-worst route on both devices, *every
time*. The path is sequential and visible to a returning user every
time they click "Play vs Bot" cold:

```
mount → getCommunityBot() fetch → /api/v1/rt/tables POST → redirect → render
```

- [ ] Trace each step server-side and client-side; identify the longest
      synchronous wait.
- [ ] Render an interim board *shell* (skeleton board + "Finding bot…")
      *before* `getCommunityBot()` returns — the spinner detection then
      flips when the bot is ready, not 600ms later.
- [ ] Move `getCommunityBot()` cache warming into the route entry —
      hover-prefetch `/play` from the home CTA, fire the bot fetch then.
- [ ] Verify `/api/v1/rt/tables` POST is the actual path (not socket).
      Make sure the server returns the table id immediately and SSE
      backfill picks up state, instead of a single big response.
- [ ] Re-measure with the same `--routes=PlayVsBot --runs=10` invocation.
      Target: parity with `/play` (≤ 750ms desktop, ≤ 1600ms mobile).

### Phase 2 — Database query audit + indexing pass

The schema has grown a lot since v1. Audit slow queries across hot endpoints,
especially the new ones:

- [ ] Enable Postgres `pg_stat_statements`; collect 24h of staging traffic.
- [ ] Top 20 by total time + top 20 by mean time — review each.
- [ ] Critical paths to check: tournament list (`/api/tournaments`), tournament
      detail with rounds + participants + matches eager-loaded, leaderboard,
      bot list with skills, ML session list, table presence lookups.
- [ ] Add missing indexes (most likely: `TournamentMatch (tournamentId, roundId)`,
      `TournamentParticipant (tournamentId, status)`, `BotSkill (botId, gameId)` —
      verify the partial unique still covers reads).
- [ ] Convert any lingering N+1s to `findMany` + grouped indexing
      (`groupBy`/`include`).
- [ ] **Materialized view for the leaderboard.** The current SQL
      aggregates win counts on every request. Refresh the view on
      game-end (already a single hot path). Read becomes O(rows
      returned), write cost moves out of the request thread.
- [ ] **Read replica for hot reads** (Fly Postgres supports it).
      Public read endpoints (`/leaderboard`, `/bots`, `/tournaments`)
      go to the replica; writes + auth stay on primary. Cuts write-
      lock contention on busy windows.
- [ ] **Stream large responses.** `GET /api/tournaments/:id` currently
      returns the full eager tree as one payload. With Express
      `res.write()` chunks (or NDJSON), the client can paint the
      header → bracket → participant table → match history in stages
      instead of waiting on the longest one.
- [ ] **Worker queue for off-request work.** ML training kicks, ELO
      calibration, journey event publishing — every one of these blocks
      the request that triggered it today. Push to BullMQ-style queue
      (Redis-backed); the request returns immediately.
- [ ] **Pre-warm critical caches on boot, not first request.** Built-in
      bot roster, puzzles, system config — load on `app.listen` callback
      so the first user doesn't pay the miss.
- [ ] **Compress payload responses.** Confirm gzip/Brotli on JSON
      responses, not just static assets — cuts wire bytes 60–80% for
      tournament/leaderboard JSON.

### Phase 3 — Hero image + asset diet  *(shipped 2026-05-05)*

Hero image diet shipped in v1.4.0-alpha-4.1 — responsive WebP via
CSS `@media (min-width: 768px)`, **mobile 50 KB / desktop 174 KB**
(was 888 KB JPG, −94% / −80%). Full design, candidates evaluated,
and measurement table in **Appendix Z.1.6**.

**Remaining open** (not blocking — backlog items):

- [ ] Audit other public images (`landing/public/`); drop unused.
- [ ] Add `loading="lazy"` + explicit `width`/`height` on every `<img>`.
- [ ] **Subset fonts** to glyphs actually used (~25 KB vs ~120 KB).
- [ ] **SVG sprite sheet** for icons (currently inline JSX `<svg>` ships
      inside the JS chunk — moving to an external sprite would let
      icons stream and cache separately).

### Phase 4 — Cross-service network shape

The landing server proxies `/api/(classification|recurring|tournaments)/*` to
the tournament service. Each proxied call adds a hop.

- [ ] Measure: cross-service p50/p95 vs same-service.
- [ ] If the gap is meaningful, consider:
  - Direct browser → tournament service via a `tournament.<env>.fly.dev`
    subdomain + CORS (saves the proxy hop).
  - Or, push read-mostly endpoints (recurring list) into the backend with
    Redis-backed sharing.
- [ ] Audit `Connection: keep-alive` between landing↔backend, landing↔tournament
      — don't pay TLS handshake on every request.
- [ ] Confirm **HTTP/3 (QUIC)** is enabled on all Fly fronts. Cuts
      handshake latency on flaky mobile connections (vs HTTP/2's
      head-of-line blocking).
- [ ] **Same-origin auth cookie path.** Better Auth sometimes triggers a
      CORS preflight `OPTIONS` for `/api/auth/get-session`. If the
      cookie domain is set tight, this is `Access-Control-Max-Age` away
      from a noticeable savings (or eliminate the preflight entirely).
- [ ] **Audit cookie size.** Better Auth tokens can balloon (esp. with
      provider claims). Every request carries them — keep < 4 KB.
- [ ] **Combine cold-start API calls into `/api/v1/init`.** A returning
      signed-in user fires session check + bots + tournaments + journey
      progress in parallel; one combined endpoint lets the server fan
      out + return one payload, cutting N waterfalls to 1.

### Phase 5 — SSE channel + POST round-trip latency

The realtime layer was rewritten between v1 and v2 (see
`doc/Realtime_Migration_Postmortem.md`). It needs its own performance lens:

- [ ] Measure: `EventSource` open → first event latency; channel join → server
      ack; client POST move → server ack → SSE state event arrival.
- [ ] Look for redundant subscriptions in `useEventStream` (one channel per
      tab vs one shared singleton — the postmortem mentioned a singleton fix;
      verify it's still in place).
- [ ] Move idle/heartbeat traffic to a long-poll or coalesce into one channel
      to keep open connections low (Fly per-instance HTTP limits).
- [ ] Backpressure: under load, what happens when one slow consumer holds an
      SSE write? Add a watchdog.

### Phase 6 — Backend cold start / warm path

Fly machines suspend on idle. First-request latency after suspend can
dominate Ready for low-traffic regions.

- [ ] Measure cold-start time per service (backend, tournament, landing).
- [ ] Decide per service: `auto_stop_machines = false` for hot services
      (backend), keep for cold (admin?). Document the cost trade-off.
- [ ] Pre-warm critical caches (built-in bots, puzzles) on boot, not on first
      request.
- [ ] Move synchronous init out of the request path
      (Prisma engine load, journey config load).

### Phase 7 — Mobile-specific

Mobile is now first-class but never benchmarked. The 2026-05-02 snapshot
showed Mobile FCP at ~1360ms — that's the parse cost on a Moto G4 CPU.
After Phase 1 cuts the bundle, the remaining mobile gap will come from
critical-path render and CSS.

- [ ] Identify any desktop-only assumption: large tables, hover-only UI,
      keyboard shortcuts, missed touch targets.
- [ ] Audit DOM size on the heaviest mobile pages (TournamentDetailPage,
      GymPage with tabs).
- [ ] Lighthouse mobile score ≥ 90 per route as a hard CI gate.
- [ ] **Critical CSS inlined into `<head>`.** Most CSS is render-blocking
      today (`<link>` tag → server round-trip on bad networks). Extract
      the above-the-fold subset and inline it; defer the rest. Likely
      saves 50–150ms on Moto G4 / 4G FCP.
- [ ] **`touch-action: manipulation`** on tappable areas. Eliminates
      any residual 300ms tap delay; cheap one-liner.
- [ ] **Transform-only animations.** Audit any animation that uses
      `top`/`left`/`width`/`height` — replace with `transform` so it
      runs on the compositor thread, not main.
- [ ] **`content-visibility: auto`** on long off-screen sections (the
      tournament participant table when collapsed, the leaderboard rows
      below the fold, the Gym session list). Free skip-render for
      non-visible content; one CSS line per container.
- [ ] **Reduce DOM nodes** on mobile-heavy pages. TournamentDetailPage's
      1900 lines render hundreds of nodes — split via Suspense and only
      mount visible sections.
- [ ] Service Worker for offline-first shell (covered in Phase 21 below).

---

## Section B — Perceived performance

These don't move the latency floor but make the platform *feel* faster.
v1 covered skeletons, hover prefetch, optimistic moves, optimistic writes
— all good and shipped. v2 extends to the new surfaces.

### Phase 8 — Skeletons everywhere new

Every page added since v1 should have a content-shaped skeleton, not a
spinner.

- [ ] `TournamentsPage` — list of tournament cards skeletons.
- [ ] `TournamentDetailPage` — header + bracket + participant table skeletons.
- [ ] `BotProfilePage` — bot header + skill cards + ELO chart.
- [ ] `Profile` — accordion frames render with skeletons inside.
- [ ] `Spar` / `Tables` — table card skeletons.
- [ ] Audit: any place where a `<Spinner />` is the first thing rendered after
      route change is a skeleton candidate.

### Phase 9 — Optimistic / streaming everywhere

- [ ] Tournament register: optimistic "Registered ✓" pill before the server
      ack (with rollback on NO_SKILL etc.).
- [ ] Bot create: bot card appears immediately with a faded "saving…" badge.
- [ ] Skill add: pill appears in `setBots` optimistic merge (already done in
      Profile — verify Gym uses the same path).
- [ ] Move events: already optimistic for player; verify bot moves animate
      smoothly when the SSE event arrives.
- [ ] Streaming responses for large GETs (tournament detail with 100+
      matches) — render the bracket as JSON streams in.
- [ ] **Partial-UI loading states.** Replace `Loading…` with progress
      narration: "Found bot, building table…" / "Bracket ready, fetching
      participants…". Same wait time, lower perceived latency.
- [ ] **Animation cover during fetch.** A 200ms fade/slide on route
      change can hide a 200ms fetch entirely — the wait reads as polish.

### Phase 10 — Hover-intent prefetch + "warm next" patterns

v1 added hover prefetch on nav links. Extend:

- [ ] On `/tournaments`, hover-prefetch each tournament's detail JSON.
- [ ] On `/profile?section=bots`, hover-prefetch `/gym?bot=:id` chunks for
      each row.
- [ ] On match end (post-cup), prefetch the next likely route (next match,
      coaching card).
- [ ] On `/play`, after first move, prefetch the rematch flow's chunks.
- [ ] **Pre-render the next likely route** in a hidden iframe / shadow
      DOM during idle time on slow paths (post-cup celebrations, match
      results). Click feels instant.

### Phase 11 — Route transition polish

- [ ] Re-evaluate the v1 fade transition under React 18 Suspense — does it
      conflict with streaming UI?
- [ ] Add `view-transitions` API where supported (Chrome) for snap-zero
      route transitions on the same-document navigations.

### Phase 12 — In-game feel

- [ ] Confirm sound latency is still nailed (the capture-phase pointerdown
      listener in `soundStore.js` — per CLAUDE.md, must not be removed).
- [ ] Animation budgets: every move, popup, modal — none > 200ms.
- [ ] Reduce-motion respect on every animation.

---

## Section C — Newly heavy surfaces (deserve their own pass)

### Phase 13 — Tournament page perf

`TournamentDetailPage` is the heaviest page in the app (1900+ lines, eager
loads rounds + participants + matches + their users). It runs before / during /
after the cup journey and shows under load on Cup days.

- [ ] Hard target: cold mobile Ready ≤ 600ms even with 32 participants and
      a full bracket.
- [ ] Split the page: bracket + participant table + match history are
      independent, render each behind its own Suspense boundary.
- [ ] Server: paginate completed matches; only the current round needs full
      detail.
- [ ] Memoize bracket layout math; profile re-renders when SSE events fire.
- [ ] Confirm `ParticipantTable` disambiguation (just shipped in 3.8.C) doesn't
      do per-render allocation.
- [ ] **`useDeferredValue`** on the bracket + participant lists when SSE
      pushes a new event. Render the new state at lower priority than
      user input (React 18).
- [ ] **Memoize `BracketMatch`** — currently re-renders on every SSE
      event for the whole bracket, even matches that didn't change.
- [ ] **`content-visibility: auto`** on rounds the user has scrolled
      past or off-screen.

### Phase 14 — Gym page perf + ML compute

The Gym detail panel re-mounts whole tab trees on bot/skill switch, and
ML inference today runs on the main thread (jank during play).

- [ ] Ensure keep-alive (`display: none`) survives the new bot→skill drilldown.
- [ ] ML model fetch should stream — show training history first, then current
      model weights.
- [ ] **Web Worker for ML inference.** Offload `getMoveForModel` for ML
      bots to a worker so the main thread never janks during a move.
- [ ] **WASM minimax / AlphaZero.** Could move bot move latency from
      ~30ms to <5ms. Compile the minimax engine to WASM behind a flag;
      benchmark vs JS. Bigger payoff once Connect4 lands (state space
      grows).
- [ ] **OffscreenCanvas for game render** (where applicable). Frees
      main thread for UI during high-FPS games like Pong.
- [ ] **`requestIdleCallback`** for journey events, telemetry, and
      RUM flushes — never compete with user input.

### Phase 15 — Intelligent Guide journey

The journey adds bus events, popups, scrim spotlights, and re-renders on
every step trigger. Measure — it's a likely INP regressor.

- [ ] INP audit on each step trigger; confirm < 100ms.
- [ ] Memoize `JourneyCard` re-renders.
- [ ] Lazy-load step-specific components (TrainGuidedModal, BotCreatedPopup).
- [ ] Confirm guide store mutations don't cascade through the whole tree
      (split selectors).

### Phase 16 — Tables-as-primitive overhead

Tables underlie spar, journey demos, PvB, PvP, and tournament HvB. Verify the
common path is hot:

- [ ] `tablePresence` lookups: O(1) per join? Memory footprint at 1000 active
      tables?
- [ ] `botGameRunner`: parallel runs OK at 50 concurrent demo tables?
- [ ] `createTableTracked` resource counter overhead — single Redis call or
      multi-hop?

## Section C2 — Compute, cache, and architecture (added from brainstorm)

These are bigger swings than the per-phase tactics above. Each one is a
"could be a project" rather than a checklist item, but they're listed
here so the option is visible when the data points to them.

### Phase 19 — Compute relocation

Today, all heavy compute runs on the user's main thread:

- ML training (Q-learning, DQN, AlphaZero) — browser-only.
- ML inference (`getMoveForModel`) — main thread.
- Game logic (minimax, AlphaZero MCTS) — main thread JS.
- Journey events, ELO calibration — request thread on backend.

Targets after this phase:

- [ ] **Web Worker for ML inference.** Offload to a worker; main thread
      never janks during a move. Pairs with Phase 14.
- [ ] **WASM for minimax / AlphaZero.** Compile the engines to WASM
      behind a feature flag; benchmark vs the JS engines. Expected
      10–100× faster move computation. Critical for Connect4 (tied to
      `doc/Connect4_Ship_Checklist.md` Spike A on TF.js).
- [ ] **OffscreenCanvas for game render.** When games like Pong land,
      keep the render loop off the main thread.
- [ ] **Move ML training to a backend worker.** Tracked in
      `doc/Connect4_Ship_Checklist.md` Spike B — perf is one input;
      architectural decision is broader (mobile training, headless
      cluster runs, training on devices that can't keep a tab open).
- [ ] **`requestIdleCallback`** for journey events, telemetry, RUM
      flushes — never compete with user input on the main thread.

### Phase 20 — Cache & app shell

Today: warm visits read from `localStorage` for some stores, but the
HTML / JS / CSS still hits the network every time.

- [ ] **Service Worker app shell.** Cache the index HTML + the vendor
      chunks; serve from cache on second visit; revalidate in background.
      Repeat-visit Ready ≈ 0ms. Highest-leverage perceived-perf change
      not yet in v2.
- [ ] **IndexedDB for tournament/leaderboard JSON.** Faster than
      localStorage at size; survives reload. Stale-while-revalidate
      directly off IDB.
- [ ] **Edge response cache** on Fly for public reads (`/leaderboard`,
      `/bots`, `/tournaments`). Backend never sees cached requests.
- [ ] **HTTP `immutable` cache headers** on hashed asset URLs
      (`max-age=31536000, immutable`). Confirm Fly is doing this.
- [ ] **Persist Zustand stores** so warm boot has full state — guide
      progress, sound prefs, ui sort orders, etc.

#### Phase 20 — implementation scoping (logged 2026-05-05)

Phase 20 is the highest-leverage perceived-perf change still pending in v2 and the #2 slot on the Top-5 chart. The single sub-item that delivers the headline (warm Ready 370 ms → ~50–100 ms) is the Service Worker app shell; the rest are supporting cleanups. This subsection captures the audit + ordering done before kicking off implementation so the work doesn't drift.

##### Current state (verified on prod 2026-05-05, v1.4.0-alpha-4.5)

- ✅ `index.html` → `cache-control: no-cache` (correct — forces revalidation so deploys take effect immediately).
- ✅ Hashed assets under `/assets/*` → `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000` (1y, correct).
- ⚠️ **Missing `immutable` keyword** on hashed assets — browsers may still send revalidation requests on hard reload. Cheap fix.
- ✅ A hand-rolled SW already lives at `landing/public/sw.js` — single-purpose Web Push handler. Registers **lazily** via `landing/src/lib/pushSubscribe.js` only when the user opts into push, and explicitly does **no** caching ("the app is an online experience"). Phase 20 needs to extend this SW (not replace) and switch to **eager** registration on app boot.
- ✅ Zustand `persist` middleware is already on 3 of 4 stores (`guideStore`, `notifSoundStore`, `soundStore`). `gymStore` is **intentionally** transient — its only field (`isTraining`) suppresses idle logout during a training session and must NOT survive a closed tab, otherwise idle-logout stays suppressed across sessions. **20.5 closes as a no-op** — the audit conclusion supersedes the original "easy completion" framing.
- ✅ Compression on at the express layer (`compression()` middleware in `landing/server.js`); brotli is added by Fly's edge.
- The existing `pushSubscribe.js` already does `navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')` — Phase 20.2 only needs to add an *eager* call from `main.supported.jsx` (not a duplicate, since `register` is idempotent on the same URL).

##### Sub-items, ordered by leverage / risk

| # | Item | Effort | Risk | Real impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **20.1** | Add `immutable` to asset cache headers | 30 min | low | Saves a few revalidation HEADs on hard reload | ✅ Shipped 2026-05-05. `landing/server.js` `setHeaders` now emits `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for `/assets/*` and `no-cache` for `sw.js` (was implicitly 1y). |
| **20.1b** | SW kill-switch endpoint (insurance) | 1 hour | low | Operator can flip a config flag and every SW in the wild self-unregisters within ~30s | ✅ Shipped 2026-05-05. `GET /api/v1/config/sw` returns `{ enabled, version }` from SystemConfig keys `sw.enabled` / `sw.version`. Authless, `Cache-Control: max-age=30`. Runbook in `Guide_Operations.md` §5.8. **Built before 20.2** so we never ship an SW we can't kill. |
| **20.2** | Eager SW registration + extend `sw.js` for app-shell caching | 1.5 days | **medium** | Warm Ready 370 ms → ~50–100 ms (the **headline** Phase 20 win) | ✅ Shipped to dev 2026-05-05 (verification on staging pending). `landing/public/sw.js` extended with `install` (skipWaiting), `activate` (cache cleanup + kill-switch consult), and `fetch` (cache-first for `/assets/*`, SWR for navigation, network-first for static, never for `/api/*` or `/socket.io/*`). Eager registration via `requestIdleCallback` in `main.supported.jsx`. Push handler unchanged. `SW_VERSION` constant (currently 1) scopes cache names so a bump auto-cycles caches. Skipped runtime precache — first navigation populates cache, second is warm; simpler than parsing the Vite manifest. |
| **20.3** | SWR data layer for public reads (`/leaderboard`, `/tournaments`, `/bots`) | 1 day | low–medium | Cuts perceived wait on Tournaments / Rankings from "spinner" to "instant + refresh" | ✅ Shipped to dev 2026-05-05. New `useSWRish(key, fetcher, { maxAgeMs })` hook in `landing/src/lib/swr.js` (10 unit tests). RankingsPage and TournamentsPage retrofitted off the older `cachedFetch` / hand-rolled `load()` paths. Public bots index doesn't exist as a page so the third bullet is a no-op. **TablesPage deferred** — it's authed, SSE-driven (real-time freshness wins over cache-first paint), and has an optimistic-create branch that needs a `mutate()` extension on the hook. Tracked as 20.3b below. |
| **20.3b** | TablesPage SWR retrofit | 30 min | low | Authed users get a cached-paint on revisit before the network round-trip; SSE handler still drives live updates | ✅ Shipped to dev 2026-05-05. Added `mutate(updater)` to `useSWRish` (functional-update aware, cache-write-through, clears `isStale`/`error`) so the optimistic-prepend on table create still works. Cache key encodes all five filter dimensions (`page:status:game:date:q`). 4 new mutate tests. |
| **20.4** | IndexedDB for cached lists | 0.5 day | low | Storage-limit relief vs localStorage; JSON survives reload | Wrapper around `idb` package. Replaces the localStorage backings inside the SWR cache from 20.3. Trivially deferrable to after 20.3 if localStorage payload sizes prove fine. |
| **20.5** | Persist `gymStore` | — | — | — | **Closed as no-op 2026-05-05.** `gymStore.isTraining` is intentionally transient; persisting it would keep idle-logout suppressed across sessions. The other 3 stores already use `persist`. |

**Total: ~3 dev-days. Highest-leverage unit is 20.2.** That alone closes the Top-5 #2 slot.

##### Critical risks to plan around (20.2 specifically)

1. **SW persistence.** A buggy SW lives on user devices until it self-updates. Mitigations:
   - Version constant in the SW (`SW_VERSION`) wired in at build time via Vite `define` so cache keys cycle on deploy.
   - **Admin kill switch** — backend endpoint (`/api/v1/admin/sw/kill`) that returns a tombstone JSON the SW reads on each `fetch`; on tombstone the SW calls `registration.unregister()` and clears all caches. Build this **before** the SW ships, not after.
   - Keep `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` on `install`/`activate` (already in place) so updates roll out without requiring a tab close.

2. **Cache invalidation on deploy.** Strategy: precache list keyed by `SW_VERSION`; `activate` handler deletes any cache whose name doesn't match the current version. Pair with `index.html` already being `no-cache` — first byte after deploy is fresh, asset URLs are content-hashed and immutable, so the precache list rebuilds cleanly per deploy.

3. **Push handler must keep working.** Extending the SW means adding `install` / `activate` / `fetch` to the same file — push code untouched. Smoke-test both paths (push receive + asset cache hit) on every SW change.

4. **Cookie + auth on `/` revalidation.** The SW must NOT cache `/api/*` (auth, session, mutations). Cache scope is strictly: `/`, `/index.html`, `/assets/*`, `/favicon.svg`, fonts/icons. Runtime fetches for `/api/v1/auth/get-session` and friends bypass the SW entirely. Confirm via the `fetch` event request URL filter on the first commit.

5. **Better Auth flow.** Sign-in posts to `/api/auth/sign-in/email` and reads cookies — both must bypass SW. The path filter from #4 covers this; explicit test: sign in with a fresh user behind a registered SW and confirm the session cookie lands.

##### Explicitly out of scope for Phase 20 itself

- **E5 supercharger items** (SW as canonical realtime SSE substrate, Background Sync for offline moves, IDB SSE replay, Periodic Background Sync, Push for cup events, WebShare). Each is multi-day with its own risk profile. Tracked separately at §E5 — pursue only after Phase 20 base ships and RUM cohort data validates the cache-shell win.
- **Edge response cache on Fly** (currently bulleted under Phase 20 above). Fly's HTTP cache requires app-level config + invalidation strategy that interacts with Better Auth cookies. **Recommendation:** pull this bullet out of Phase 20 and create a separate Phase 20.6 for it post-base. Lower priority once SW + SWR are in place — they capture most of the same win client-side without the auth-cache footgun.

##### Rollout sequence (calendar)

1. **Day 1 AM:** 20.1 (`immutable` header) + 20.5 (closed as no-op — see audit row above). ✅ Shipped 2026-05-05.
2. **Day 1 PM:** SW kill-switch endpoint (20.1b) + runbook entry in `Guide_Operations.md` §5.8. ✅ Shipped 2026-05-05.
3. **Day 2:** 20.2 — extend `sw.js`, eager registration in `main.supported.jsx`. ✅ Shipped to dev 2026-05-05; ship-on-by-default rather than `?sw=1` flag because the kill switch (20.1b) is the rollback. Verification on staging pending.
4. **Day 3 AM:** 20.3 — SWR hook + retrofit `TournamentsPage` + `RankingsPage`. ✅ Shipped to dev 2026-05-05. `TablesPage` deferred to 20.3b.
5. **Day 3 PM:** 20.4 — promote SWR backing to IDB if payload sizes warrant; else close as YAGNI.
6. **Day 4:** RUM verification. F11.5 cohort data should be flowing by then. Compare returning-cohort Ready on staging pre-/post-Phase-20; if it's not ≤100 ms, debug before declaring done. Update Top-5 chart with measured delta.

##### Verification plan

- **Synthetic:** add a `--cache-warmed` mode to `perf/perf-v2.js` that registers + warms the SW, then measures Ready on a second visit. Expected delta on cold-anon mobile: 370 ms → ~50–100 ms.
- **RUM:** the F11.5 cohort split (`returning` vs `first-visit`) is the production read. Returning-cohort Ready p50 should drop into double digits. Tracked alongside FCP / LCP per cohort in the admin perf vitals dashboard.
- **Smoke:** add a Playwright assertion that, after a navigation in a context with the SW registered, a second navigation reads `/assets/*` from disk cache (response time ≤5 ms via Performance API).

### Phase 21 — Architecture experiments (longshots)

Each is a meaningful re-architecture; pursue only if Tier 0 + Tier 1
data shows the gap they'd close. Listed for completeness.

- [ ] **Server-side render the landing page (`/`) only.** It's mostly
      static. React 19 RSC or a tiny SSR shell could deliver Ready ≈
      TTFB. Other routes stay SPA.
- [ ] **Edge functions for `/leaderboard` / `/bots`.** Fly Functions
      could serve these from cache without touching the Node process,
      cutting cold-start exposure entirely.
- [ ] **Replace JSON-over-HTTP with gRPC-Web** for hot endpoints —
      smaller payloads, schema validation, generated clients.
- [ ] **Migrate hot read endpoints off Express to Hono on the edge** —
      lower per-request overhead than full Express middleware stack.
- [ ] **React Server Components for static-ish pages** — Settings,
      Puzzles, parts of Profile. Cut their JS to ~0 KB.

## Section D — Instrumentation as a first-class deliverable

Performance work without instrumentation is fishing in the dark. v1 measured
synthetically once and stopped. v2 makes measurement continuous.

### D0 — Pre-Tier-0 instrumentation (landed 2026-05-04, `dev`)

Before committing to Tier 0 work, the toolbox is filled in so each
tackled item is *measurable* before and after. Synthetic harnesses
that exist today on `dev`:

| Aspect | Script | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| Cold-page totals | `perf/perf-v2.js` | TTFB / FCP / LCP / Ready per route × device, with `--extended-resources` for late-loading bytes |
| Interaction (INP) | `perf/perf-inp.js` | p50/p95 INP per common interaction × route |
| Backend hot endpoints | `perf/perf-backend-p95.js` | p50/p95/p99 for `/api/version`, `/api/v1/bots`, `/api/v1/leaderboard`, `/api/auth/get-session`, `/api/tournaments` |
| SSE round-trip (F4) | `perf/perf-sse-rtt.js` | Splits POST move → SSE event into server.lookup, server.apply, redis publish→pickup, broker pickup→write, network legs |
| Cold-page waterfall (F2) | `perf/perf-waterfall.js` | When the route's primary `/api/*` fires + how long it takes — sizes the prize for `<link rel=preload>` and inline initial payload |
| Long-task profile | `perf/perf-longtasks.js` | count / sum / max long tasks per cold load (Moto-G4 + 4× CPU throttle for mobile) — sizes Phase 1 / 1b TBT prize |
| Bundle composition | `perf/perf-bundle.js` | Per-chunk raw / gzip / brotli for every dist/ asset; checked-in baseline for diff after Phase 1 |

Backend-side instrumentation:
- Global `Server-Timing: handler;dur=X` middleware on every backend
  response (preserves route-level timings like the move POST's
  `lookup, apply`). CORS exposes `Server-Timing`. The waterfall +
  any future ad-hoc test can read server vs network breakdown for
  every `/api/*` call without per-handler instrumentation.
- Move POST emits `lookup;dur=X, apply;dur=Y`.
- SSE broker injects `_t: { publishToPickupMs, pickupToWriteMs }`
  into every payload (publishMs comes free from the Redis stream id).

**Key bundle finding:** `main.supported.js` is **1506 KB raw / 319 KB
brotli** — half of total brotli bytes shipped. This is the F5 / Phase
1 target; the rest of the JS budget (16 chunks) is mostly small
named splits (TrainTab, ExplainabilityTab, game, etc.).

### D1 — RUM (Real-User Monitoring) (landed 2026-05-04, `dev`)

Synthetic baselines see what one Playwright run on a controlled
connection sees; RUM sees what real users on real networks actually
experience.

- **Client:** `landing/src/lib/rum.js` registers `onFCP / onLCP /
  onINP / onCLS / onTTFB` from `web-vitals`. Each metric appends to a
  per-tab queue; on `pagehide` (or first `visibility:hidden`) the
  queue is drained as a single beacon to `/api/v1/perf/vitals` via
  `navigator.sendBeacon` with explicit `application/json` content
  type (the default `text/plain` is silently dropped by Express's
  body parser — easy footgun, captured here so we don't repeat it).
  Sampling: `VITE_RUM_SAMPLE_RATE` (default `1.0`); decision is
  sticky for the tab.
- **Backend:** `POST /api/v1/perf/vitals` (route
  `backend/src/routes/perfVitals.js`). No auth, no SSE-session
  required. Validates each entry (allowed name set, finite numeric
  range 0–1e7, capped 32 vitals per beacon), persists via Prisma
  `createMany`, always returns 204. 8 vitest cases cover happy path,
  unknown names, garbage values, oversize beacons, DB failure.
- **Schema:** `PerfVital` table — anonymous (`sessionId` is a
  per-tab random hex, never a user id), no IP. Indexes on
  `(name, route, createdAt)` and `(env, name, createdAt)` so the
  obvious aggregations (p50/p75/p95 per route × device × env over
  time) stay cheap.
- **Smoke:** Playwright headless run hits `/`, fires
  `visibilitychange → hidden`, beacon arrives 204, three rows land
  in DB (TTFB, FCP, CLS — LCP/INP need real interaction to register).

**Privacy boundary:** never sends `userId`, never stores IP, no
fingerprinting. The only durable identifier is the tab-scoped
`sessionId`, which has no cross-tab persistence.

**Next:** ship to staging + prod with the next `/stage` cycle. After
~1 week of real-user data — or immediately, with the synthetic driver
in D2 — we have an honest p50/p75/p95 baseline to diff every Tier 0
deploy against. Admin dashboard for it landed 2026-05-04 (see D3).

### D2 — Synthetic RUM driver  *(planned)*

D1 only fills `perf_vitals` when real humans load pages. Staging has
near-zero organic traffic; prod takes hours-to-days to accumulate
stable percentiles. So before we can compare a Tier 0 change against a
"clean" baseline we need a way to *guarantee* a complete sample set.
The synthetic driver is that guarantee — Playwright-scripted sessions
that exercise every route on both desktop and mobile profiles and let
the same `web-vitals` listeners + beacon do the reporting.

**Script:** `perf/perf-rum-driver.js` (TBD).

- Launches N parallel `chromium` contexts (default 5; configurable).
- Iterates the standard route inventory (`/`, `/play`,
  `/tournaments`, `/rankings`, `/gym`, `/profile`, …) per device
  profile (desktop, mobile w/ 4× CPU throttle via CDP, optionally
  4G / 3G network throttle).
- Per route: load → wait for LCP candidate → perform a representative
  interaction so INP fires (button click that doesn't navigate) →
  trigger `visibilitychange:hidden` so the beacon flushes → close
  context. Passive page loads alone don't yield LCP / INP / CLS, so
  the interaction step is non-optional.
- Tags every session with a recognizable UA suffix
  (`XO-Synthetic/1.0`) so the aggregation endpoint can split organic
  vs synthetic via `userAgent ILIKE '%XO-Synthetic/%'`. No schema
  change, no separate ingest path — same `POST /api/v1/perf/vitals`.
- Backend `GET /admin/health/perf/vitals` gains a
  `?source=organic|synthetic|all` filter (default `organic`) so the
  admin dashboard can show either view without polluting the real
  baseline.

**Cadence:**

- *On-demand* (always available): developer runs
  `BASE_URL=https://xo-frontend-staging.fly.dev node perf/perf-rum-driver.js`
  before and after a change to capture before/after percentiles in one
  session.
- *Scheduled* (CI): a GH Actions cron drives staging every ~6h so the
  staging RUM dashboard never shows empty bars. **Prod is not on the
  cron** — synthetic samples on prod would skew real-user numbers, so
  prod runs are manual-dispatch only, used when "what does INP look
  like under prod backend load?" is the actual question.

**Caveats:**

- Synthetic INP is bounded by Playwright's input-event latency, which
  is tighter than a real human. Treat synthetic INP as a *stability /
  regression* signal, not as an absolute number for budget compliance.
- Network conditions skew the picture if not pinned. Default to one
  desktop + one mobile-throttled profile per run; optionally include
  3G / 4G via CDP `Network.emulateNetworkConditions` for the long-tail.
- Synthetic rows accumulate cost in `perf_vitals`. Cleanup is a
  scheduled prune (D2.1) — see below — not a per-run delete, so
  comparison runs across days remain possible.

### D2.1 — Synthetic-row retention & data hygiene  *(planned)*

The synthetic driver produces a continuous trickle of rows; without a
prune, `perf_vitals` grows linearly forever (a 6h staging cron writing
~5 routes × 2 device profiles × ~5 vitals = ~50 rows/cycle = ~200
rows/day = ~75k rows/year per cron alone, before any prod synthetic
or any organic). Cheap on day one, painful to fix at year three. So
the prune ships with D2.

**Goals.**

1. Keep `perf_vitals` bounded so admin queries stay sub-100 ms even
   at year-scale.
2. Never delete data mid-experiment — a comparison run that started
   yesterday must still have its baseline rows tomorrow.
3. Default behaviour is safe: organic rows are untouched, synthetic
   rows are kept long enough to span a typical Tier 0 PR cycle.

**What gets pruned (and what doesn't).**

| Source | Default retention | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic (`userAgent ILIKE '%XO-Synthetic/%'`) | 14 days | Long enough to span a feature branch + review + post-merge diff. Tunable up. |
| Organic (everything else) | unlimited | Real-user rows are scarce on staging and irreplaceable on prod. Only prune if the table actually outgrows its index — measured, not pre-emptive. |
| Smoke / dev rows (`env = 'local'`) | 7 days | Kept short — they're noise once the smoke run that wrote them has been verified. |

**Cadence.** Nightly. Implemented as a recurring `scheduledJob` (type
`perf_vitals_prune`) registered with the existing
`scheduledJobs.js` dispatcher: handler runs the deletes, then enqueues
the next run 24 h out. If the dispatcher misses a tick (process
restart, env unavailable), startup recovery resets stuck RUNNING jobs
and the next tick catches up — no lost data, no double-prune.

**Implementation sketch.**

- New handler module `backend/src/services/perfVitalsRetentionService.js`
  exporting `pruneSynthetic({ olderThan })`, `pruneSmoke({ olderThan })`,
  and a `runPrune()` orchestrator. Each delete uses the existing
  `(env, name, createdAt)` index — an `EXPLAIN` against the staging
  DB before merge confirms an index scan, not a seq scan.
- Bootstrap from `backend/src/index.js`: register the
  `perf_vitals_prune` handler, then enqueue the first run if no
  PENDING / RUNNING row already exists. Idempotent across restarts.
- Test coverage: unit tests for each prune function (boundary on the
  cutoff, no-op when nothing matches, error path doesn't tombstone
  the job), plus a handler-level test that asserts the next run is
  re-enqueued.

**Pause / extend for long comparison runs.** Two system_config keys
(`getSystemConfig` / `setSystemConfig` already wired through the
admin panel):

- `perf.retention.synthetic.days` (number, default `14`) — bump to
  `60` before a multi-week experiment, drop back to `14` afterwards.
- `perf.retention.paused` (bool, default `false`) — hard pause; the
  handler short-circuits to a no-op while still re-enqueueing itself
  so resuming is just flipping the flag back. Useful when a
  multi-day "hold everything" capture is in flight.

Both are read at the top of the handler so a flip takes effect on
the next tick (≤ 24 h) without a backend restart.

**Observability.** Each run logs `{ prunedSynthetic, prunedSmoke,
keptOrganic, durationMs, paused }` at info level. The numbers also
land in the metrics snapshot so the admin Health dashboard's
`/admin/health/sockets` history shows whether the table is
stabilizing or still growing.

**One-time scrub (only if needed).** If any synthetic rows leak into
the table *before* D2 ships its UA tag, they'd be indistinguishable
from organic. Mitigation:

1. Ship D2 (UA tag + `?source` filter) and D2.1 (prune) **in the same
   PR** — this is the primary defence; there's no untagged-synthetic
   period.
2. Belt-and-suspenders: a one-shot admin endpoint
   `POST /admin/health/perf/vitals/scrub-synthetic-before` accepting a
   timestamp, runnable manually if step 1 ever fails. Behind
   `requireAdmin`, idempotent, returns the row count it deleted. Add
   only if step 1's pre-merge testing reveals a gap; otherwise skip.

**Future: dedicated `source` column.** The UA-suffix filter is fine at
year-one scale (`userAgent` is already indexed via the
`(name, route, createdAt)` composite for the hot path; the source
filter only matters on infrequent admin queries). If the synthetic
volume ever rises to where the `ILIKE` becomes hot, add a
`source enum('organic', 'synthetic', 'smoke')` column and a
backfill — but not before, since the column adds write-side cost on
every beacon and the current shape is already costly enough at
hundreds of rows/sec organic.

**Sequencing — when does cleanup actually happen?** Three distinct
moments to keep separate:

1. *Before the next `/promote`* (i.e., right now): **no cleanup
   needed.** D1 just landed on dev; prod's `perf_vitals` is empty.
   The `/stage` + `/promote` we're queueing pushes code, not data.
2. *Between `/promote` and the synthetic driver going live*: **also
   no cleanup needed.** Real users start writing organic rows
   immediately; that's exactly what we want. The perf-* scripts
   re-baseline produces JSONs in `perf/baselines/`, never touching
   `perf_vitals`.
3. *Once D2 + D2.1 land*: cleanup becomes ongoing — the prune does
   its job nightly, queries default to `?source=organic`, the
   dashboard stays clean. **No "cleanup phase" between push and data
   collection** — the cleanliness primitives ship inside D2 itself,
   not as a separate gate.

### D3 — Admin Health dashboard panels (landed 2026-05-04, `dev`)

The on-call surface for everything D0–D2 produces, all under
`/admin/health`:

- **Real-User Web Vitals** — `GET /api/v1/admin/health/perf/vitals` —
  per-(route, metric) p50/p75/p95 with rating-mix bars, 1h/24h/7d
  toggle, env breakdown. Color-coded against the
  [web-vitals thresholds](https://web.dev/articles/vitals)
  (LCP ≤ 2.5s good / > 4s poor, INP ≤ 200ms / > 500ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 / > 0.25, …).
- **Perf Baselines (dev-only)** — `GET /api/v1/admin/perf/baselines{,/:filename}` —
  read-only browser of `perf/baselines/*.json` with kind filter and
  click-to-view JSON. Disabled on Fly.io (no `PERF_BASELINES_DIR`)
  because the JSONs only exist on the dev machine that ran the perf
  scripts. Strict filename regex + resolved-path check guard against
  traversal.

Tests: 6 + 8 vitest cases on the backend; UI is straightforward
presentation.

### Phase 17 — Per-PR perf gates

- [ ] CI runs `perf/perf.js` against a preview env on every PR; comments the
      diff vs `main`.
- [ ] Bundle-size guard fails PR if any chunk grows > 5% without an
      explicit `perf-ok` label.
- [ ] Backend test suite asserts p95 < budget for the 5 hottest endpoints
      (run against an in-memory load generator).

### Phase 18 — Production perf dashboard

- [ ] Public-internal Grafana page: per-route Ready p75/p95 (RUM), per-endpoint
      backend p95, SSE channel health, error budgets.
- [ ] Weekly "perf review" cadence — owner reviews against budgets, files
      issues for any breach > 7 days.

## Section E — Aggressive bets (re-review 2026-05-04)

A second pass over the plan exposed several large-leverage ideas that
weren't in any phase. Some are nearly-free additions to existing phases;
others are real moonshots. They're grouped by what they buy you, not
by tier — surface them where they fit, then promote the ones the data
backs after Tier 0 lands.

### E1 — Free wins (add to Tier 0 / quick-wins)

These cost ≤ a day each, ship behind feature flags if needed, and
should be done alongside the bundle work — most don't even require a
benchmark to justify.

- [ ] **103 Early Hints from Fly.** Send `<link rel="preload">` for
      `vendor-react` + `main` + critical CSS *before* the backend has
      finished computing the HTML response. Saves 50–150ms by overlapping
      TTFB with preload. Fly's edge supports this; verify and wire it up.
- [ ] **Speculation Rules API** (`<script type="speculationrules">`).
      Chrome / Edge will prerender same-origin links the user is likely
      to click — no JS, no library. Add a JSON block with the home,
      `/play`, `/leaderboard`, and `/profile` URLs. Free instant
      navigation on Chromium.
- [ ] **HTTP/3 0-RTT for returning visitors.** Cuts the TLS handshake
      to zero on warm connections. Fly supports HTTP/3; confirm 0-RTT
      isn't disabled for safety reasons we don't actually need.
- [ ] **Resource hints for auth providers** — `<link rel="preconnect">`
      / `dns-prefetch` for `accounts.google.com` and `appleid.apple.com`
      in `<head>` so the OAuth round-trip starts warm. Sign-in feels
      ~200ms faster on cold visitors who click immediately.
- [ ] **Brotli quality 11 at build** (vs Vite's default 6). Slower
      build, zero runtime cost, ~5–10% smaller JS payloads. Set
      `compress: { algorithm: 'brotliCompress', compressionOptions: { level: 11 } }`
      in the Vite config.
- [ ] **CSS `image-set()`** for the hero — `background-image:
      image-set("hero.avif" 1x type("image/avif"), "hero.webp" 1x)`.
      Browser picks best format automatically; supersedes manual
      `<picture>` wrapping for CSS backgrounds.
- [ ] **CSS `aspect-ratio`** on every `<img>` and lazy section. Locks
      layout before bytes arrive — kills CLS on the home, leaderboard,
      and tournament pages without manual `width` / `height`.
- [ ] **BlurHash placeholders** for the hero, bot avatars, and any
      future user uploads. ~30 bytes per image, decoded synchronously
      to a 32×32 canvas — instant visual content under the real image.
- [ ] **Variable fonts.** Replace separate Inter regular/semibold/bold
      static files with one variable font (`Inter.var.woff2`). Roughly
      half the font weight on the wire.
- [ ] **`font-display: optional`** for non-critical text (e.g., Inter
      Tight on hero headlines). Never blocks render, even on slow
      networks.
- [ ] **Modern-only build by default.** Drop the legacy bundle in
      production (Vite still builds it). 99% of traffic is evergreen
      Chromium / Safari / Firefox; the legacy chunk is dead weight.
- [ ] **`scheduler.yield()`** in any loop > 5ms (bracket layout, journey
      derivations, leaderboard sort). Hands control back to the browser
      between chunks of work — keeps INP under 100ms even on Moto G4.
- [ ] **`isInputPending()`** as the cheap version when `scheduler.yield`
      isn't shipped: pause heavy work mid-loop if the user is touching
      the screen.

### E2 — React re-render lockdown

The existing phases mention `useDeferredValue` and `React.memo` on
`BracketMatch`, but the platform has a deeper render-cost story.

- [ ] **Atomize Zustand stores.** The current game store, journey
      store, and ui store each have many subscribers. Splitting each
      into per-domain slices (e.g., `tableStore`, `seatsStore`,
      `boardStore`) means an SSE state event re-renders only what
      actually changed. Easy diff pattern; large measurable win on
      TournamentDetail under live updates.
- [ ] **`useTransition` on every nav click.** Keeps the current page
      interactive while the next route's chunks load — visible Ready
      stays low even when the next page is heavy.
- [ ] **Selective hydration where applicable.** React 18 already
      supports it; needs explicit `<Suspense>` boundaries to opt in.
      Pair with Phase 1's per-route splitting.
- [ ] **Why Did You Render audit** on TournamentDetailPage, GymPage,
      RankingsPage. Run in dev for a session, fix every flagged
      cascade. One-time effort, perpetual savings.
- [ ] **React 19 Actions + `useFormState`** for sign-in, register,
      bot-create, skill-add. Cleaner optimistic UI and built-in
      pending state — replaces hand-rolled patterns.
- [ ] **React Forget (compiler memoization)** — track stability;
      adopt when the React team marks it production-ready. Removes
      most `useMemo` / `useCallback` boilerplate, often catching
      cases hand-written memoization missed.

### E3 — Compute moonshots (Phase 14 / 19 supercharger)

The existing plan moves ML to a Web Worker. The real wins are bigger.

- [ ] **WebGPU backend for TF.js.** Newer than the WebGL backend,
      ~2–5× faster on supported hardware. Falls back to WebGL
      automatically. One config change in TF.js setup.
- [ ] **WASM SIMD for minimax.** Compile the minimax engine with the
      `simd` flag — 4–8× speedup over scalar WASM, which itself is
      ~10× faster than the JS version. Bot move latency goes from
      ~30ms to ~1ms; matters more for Connect4 + AlphaZero.
- [ ] **Quantize ML models to int8.** TensorFlow.js supports int8
      quantization at the conversion step. 4× smaller weights on
      disk + on the wire, 2–4× faster inference on CPU. Trade is
      ~1–2% accuracy, which is well within ELO noise for our game.
- [ ] **Cache compiled WASM in IndexedDB.** WebAssembly.Module is
      structured-cloneable. Compile once, store, retrieve on next
      boot — saves the JIT pass on every reload.
- [ ] **Background-train ML bots while idle.** When the user is
      reading the home page or watching a demo, run a few training
      epochs in a Web Worker. Their bot quietly improves between
      sessions.
- [ ] **Speculative bot move computation.** During the user's turn,
      precompute the bot's response to the top 3–5 likely user moves.
      User makes their move → bot's response is already cached →
      animate immediately.

### E4 — Network moonshots

- [ ] **PgBouncer in front of Fly Postgres.** Connection pooler that
      handles transient connection storms (deploy-time, cold-start
      flap). Cuts p95 tail latency on DB-bound endpoints. Standard
      Postgres infra; runs as a sidecar machine.
- [ ] **DataLoader for N+1 batching.** Especially on tournament-detail
      eager loads — fan out N participant lookups → one batched
      `SELECT … WHERE id IN (…)`. Battle-tested Node pattern; drop-in.
- [ ] **WebTransport (HTTP/3 datagrams) replacing SSE.** Lower latency
      than SSE, better connection migration when mobile users switch
      networks, supports unreliable channels for fire-and-forget. Big
      lift; do only after RUM data shows SSE is the bottleneck.
- [ ] **WebRTC peer-to-peer for PvP** once tables are seated. Server
      only relays signaling; gameplay traffic is browser-to-browser.
      Move latency drops to one round-trip on the same network. Big
      lift; meaningful only for PvP, not PvB.
- [ ] **Edge KV for read-heavy public reads.** Built-in bots, system
      config, journey config — load once at the edge, serve from
      memory; backend never sees these requests. Kills the request
      class entirely. Fly supports this via a small KV sidecar or
      Cloudflare Workers KV.
- [ ] **Stale-while-revalidate everywhere safe.** `Cache-Control:
      max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=600` on `/leaderboard`,
      `/bots`, `/tournaments` list. Browser shows cached instantly,
      fetches fresh in background. One-line backend change.
- [ ] **Compression dictionaries.** Brotli supports shared
      dictionaries across requests — train a dictionary on common
      JSON shapes (tournaments, bots, leaderboard) and ship it.
      30–50% smaller on the wire after the first request. Browser
      support arriving 2026.

### E5 — Cache & shell expansion (Phase 20 supercharger)

The existing Phase 20 mentions Service Worker app shell. Push it harder.

- [ ] **Service Worker as the canonical realtime substrate.** SW holds
      one shared SSE connection for all open tabs of the app — instead
      of N tabs × 1 SSE = N connections, it's 1 connection multiplexed
      via `BroadcastChannel`. Fly per-IP connection limits stop biting.
- [ ] **Background Sync for offline moves.** User makes a move on a
      flaky network → SW queues it → replays when connection returns.
      Player never sees a failed move.
- [ ] **IndexedDB for SSE event replay.** SW persists every state event
      to IDB; on tab reopen / reconnect, replay all missed events
      locally before the live SSE catches up. Reload feels instant.
- [ ] **Periodic Background Sync** for tournament wakeups. SW pings
      `/api/tournaments/upcoming` every 15 minutes when offline; pushes
      a notification when one starts. PWA primitive, free.
- [ ] **Push notifications for cup events.** Already partially wired
      via `pushSubscribe.js` — extend to "your match is starting" and
      "your bot won" pings.
- [ ] **WebShare API** on results pages so users share their cup wins
      to native iOS/Android share sheets. Not perf-direct, but cuts
      the friction loop that drives engagement → repeat sessions where
      the SW shell pays off.

### E6 — Predictive perf

The platform has rich session data; use it to make navigation feel
psychic.

- [ ] **Predictive prefetch from user history.** Track per-user
      navigation transitions (e.g., "users who view profile next
      view leaderboard 80% of time"). Prefetch the top-1 next route
      on every page load. Costs one tiny model + a few KB of state.
- [ ] **Pre-render the *expected* next route** in a hidden subtree.
      On `/play` cup match end, the next click is almost always
      "Continue" or "Rematch" — both routes can be fully mounted
      and ready when the click happens.
- [ ] **Speculative API calls based on cursor proximity.** As the
      cursor approaches a tournament card, fire `/api/tournaments/:id`
      before the click. Hover-prefetch as a behavior model, not just
      a CSS pseudo-class.

### E7 — Architecture longshots (Tier 4)

Real re-architectures. Each is a project. Listed for completeness so
the option is visible.

- [ ] **Bun runtime for backend + tournament services.** Cold-start
      drops from ~500ms (Node) to ~50ms (Bun) and request throughput
      goes up ~30%. Bun is Express-compatible; the migration is
      mostly testing. Collapses Phase 6 (cold-start) entirely. Risk:
      Prisma + Bun stability, Better Auth compatibility.
- [ ] **Hono + edge runtime for read-only public APIs.** Move
      `/leaderboard`, `/bots`, `/tournaments` list to Hono on Fly's
      edge. ~10× faster per request than Express, runs in every
      region. Already in Phase 21 — promote if Bun isn't ready.
- [ ] **Cloudflare Durable Objects (or Fly Replay) for tablePresence.**
      Move the in-memory presence cache to a regional state primitive.
      Frees backend machines to scale horizontally; eliminates a hot
      shared-memory table.
- [ ] **gRPC-Web for hot endpoints.** Schema-validated, smaller
      payloads, generated clients. Already in Phase 21; revisit
      after Bun.
- [ ] **Replace Better Auth with self-rolled JWT + refresh.** If the
      cookie-size + preflight overhead in Phase 4 measurements turns
      out to be load-bearing, the entire auth library may be the
      cheapest thing to swap. High-risk; only with measurement.

## Section F — Pre-launch review gaps (2026-05-04)

A second pass before starting Tier 0 surfaced gaps the existing
phases don't cover, plus DB / REST patterns the user explicitly asked
about that the plan was silent on.

### F1 — DB join shape + preloading (Phase 2 supplement)

Phase 2 calls for an index pass + `pg_stat_statements`, but doesn't
audit the *join shape* of the heaviest endpoints. Hot offenders:

- **`GET /api/tournaments/:id`** — three-level `include`:
  ```js
  include: {
    participants: { include: { user: { select: { …8 cols } } } },
    rounds:       { include: { matches: true } },
  }
  ```
  Prisma issues this as ~3 SQL queries with deep joins. On a 32-player
  bracket: 1 tournament + 32 participants joined to users + 5 rounds +
  31 matches = a single response Of ~70 rows. Watch for two issues:
  (a) `matches: true` returns *all* TournamentMatch columns including
  large unused fields (e.g. `metadata` JSONB, `botMoveLog` if present);
  (b) the participant→user join can pull users that are no longer
  competitively active. *Action:* explicit `select` on every nested
  include, drop unused columns; benchmark before/after.

- **`listBots()` ELO lookup uses an OR over `(userId, gameId)` pairs.**
  ```js
  where: { OR: eloPairs }   // N pairs → N OR branches
  ```
  Postgres can plan this poorly past ~8 branches. Rewrite as a single
  `WHERE (user_id, game_id) IN (VALUES …)` (raw SQL) or a UNION of
  exact-match subqueries; or add a composite `(user_id, game_id)`
  index if not already present. Cheap, measurable.

- **N+1 in spectate / live-state paths.** The bot-game runner emits
  state events that include only ids; the client backfills with
  separate fetches per id. Audit `useEventStream` consumers for
  any pattern that triggers a fetch loop on each event arrival.

- **Audit `select` discipline platform-wide.** Prisma defaults to
  selecting all scalar fields when `select` is omitted on a nested
  include. Three places in `listBots` already do this right; verify
  every `findMany`/`findUnique` in `backend/src/services/*` and
  `tournament/src/routes/*` follows suit.

### F2 — REST response preloading (NEW)

The cold-page Ready cost is dominated by waterfalls: HTML parses → JS
parses → bundle queries an API → API returns → render. The plan covers
the JS parse but not the *API queries during parse*.

**Instrumentation landed (2026-05-04, `dev`):**
`perf/perf-waterfall.js` measures, per route × device, when the
primary `/api/*` call fires (`requestStart` from navStart) and when
its response lands (`responseEnd`). Local sanity-check (n=3, desktop,
no network throttling) — every route's primary API doesn't fire
until ~400ms after navStart, which is pure JS parse + React mount +
`useEffect` cost (the API itself is 2–5ms locally):

| Route        | apiStart | apiTotal | LCP   | preload prize (~) |
|--------------|----------|----------|-------|-------------------|
| `/`          | 418ms    | 5ms      | 696ms | ~400ms            |
| `/tournaments` | 377ms  | 2ms      | 388ms | ~370ms            |
| `/rankings`  | 385ms    | 5ms      | 396ms | ~380ms            |

LCP on `/tournaments` and `/rankings` lands ~11ms after the API
returns — preload would shift the entire chain ~370ms earlier.
Staging/prod prize is presumably larger (longer bundle download +
bigger API total). Re-run with `--target=staging` to confirm before
committing implementation effort.

**Aside:** the waterfall also surfaces ~7 redundant `/api/session`
hits per cold page load. Filed as a separate dedupe issue; not part
of F2 itself.

- [ ] **`<link rel="preload" as="fetch">`** for the top-1 API call per
      route, emitted in the HTML `<head>` so the request fires in
      parallel with bundle download. Routes + targets:
  - `/` → `/api/v1/bots?gameId=xo` (the community bot fetch)
  - `/tournaments` → `/api/tournaments`
  - `/rankings` → `/api/v1/leaderboard?period=all&mode=all&includeBots=false`
  - `/profile` (auth) → `/api/v1/bots?ownerId=…`
- [ ] **103 Early Hints with `Link: rel=preload`** (Section E1) for
      both static chunks *and* the API preload above. Doubles the
      effect: preload starts before TTFB *and* parallel to JS parse.
- [ ] **Inline initial payload into `index.html`** for routes whose
      data shape doesn't depend on auth or query params. Static-ish
      candidates: built-in bot list, system config keys the client
      reads first paint. Cuts an entire round-trip on `/`.
- [ ] **HTTP/2 server push fallback?** Skip — browsers have removed
      it. 103 Early Hints is the modern equivalent and already in E1.
- [ ] **Wire `<Link to>` hover into a fetch warmup** (extending
      Phase 10): on hover, pre-fire the route's primary API call and
      cache the response for the upcoming nav.

### F3 — Connection pool, transactions, query plans (NEW)

Phase 2 mentions PgBouncer; doesn't audit what's already in place.

- [ ] **Prisma connection pool size.** Default is `num_cpus * 2 + 1`,
      which on Fly's `shared-cpu-1x` resolves to 3. Under modest
      concurrency (5+ simultaneous SSE move POSTs) this saturates
      and queues. Bump explicitly via `connection_limit` query param;
      benchmark p95 under load before/after.
- [ ] **Transaction footprint audit.** Hot multi-step transactions:
      bot-game runner per-move, tournament round advancement,
      training-session completion. Long transactions hold row locks
      and block concurrent reads. Profile + shrink scope where
      possible.
- [ ] **Prepared statement reuse.** Prisma's query engine prepares
      and caches statements per connection — confirm the cache is
      sized for the actual query variety (default 100; if exceeded,
      Prisma re-prepares on every call).
- [ ] **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` the top 5 slow queries** identified in the
      Phase 2 `pg_stat_statements` pass. A confirmed-slow query plan
      is what justifies an index, not a heuristic.
- [ ] **`SELECT FOR UPDATE` audit.** `tournamentService` advancement
      uses row locks; verify the lock window is bounded (no awaiting
      external service calls inside a `$transaction`).

### F4 — Phase 5 (SSE round-trip) decomposition (concrete steps)

The 0.4 data showed POST move → SSE event = 560ms / 670ms p50, with
~400ms unaccounted for between POST ack and event arrival. The single-
stream `perf-sse-rtt` decomposition (2026-05-05) put 383ms p50 of
that on `publishToPickup` (Redis XADD → broker XREAD wake). The
follow-up concurrent load test (`perf/perf-sse-load.js`,
2026-05-05) sharply rewrote what that number represents:

- **It is not Redis throughput** — `pickupToWrite` is < 1ms p50 at
  every load level, and `apply` (which includes the XADD) is < 20ms
  p50 even at c=50.
- **It is not load-related** — at c=50 concurrent users the
  publishToPickup p50 is **21ms** (vs 383ms quiet), p95 106ms.
- **It is the broker's process wake-up cost on a quiet service.**
  The broker uses `XREAD BLOCK 30_000` (`backend/src/lib/sseBroker.js:43`).
  When the backend is idle, the Node process pages out / scheduler
  deprioritises it / Redis TCP connection's recv-buffer is empty.
  The first XADD that follows pays a measurable wake-up tax
  (~150–500ms) before `Date.now()` is sampled in `dispatchEntry`.
  Once the loop is hot — i.e. any time the broker has dispatched an
  event in the last few hundred ms — that tax is ~20ms.
- **By move-index** (staging, c=5, n=5 each):
  - move 0 (cold table, may also catch broker idle): **382ms p50, 740ms p95**
  - move 1 (warm channel): 35ms p50, 49ms p95
  - move 2 (warm channel): 55ms p50, 69ms p95

#### Concurrency sweep — staging, 2026-05-05

`perf/perf-sse-load.js --target=staging --sweep=1,5,10,25` then a
follow-up `--concurrency=50`. 3 moves per virtual user, 80ms ramp.

| c   | n   | apply p50/p95 | publishToPickup p50/p95 | pickupToWrite p50/p95 | movePostAck p50/p95 | botMoveTotal p50/p95 |
|----:|----:|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|
|  1  |   3 |   7 / 8 ms    |     55 / 196 ms         |     0 / 1 ms          |   166 / 197 ms      |   257 / 367 ms       |
|  5  |  15 |   7 / 8 ms    |     55 / **740 ms**     |     0 / 0 ms          |   189 / 260 ms      |   324 / 932 ms       |
| 10  |  30 |   7 / 18 ms   |     32 / 406 ms         |     0 / 0 ms          |   195 / 304 ms      |   278 / 612 ms       |
| 25  |  75 |  15 / 45 ms   |     25 / 406 ms         |     0 / 0 ms          |   291 / 556 ms      |   391 / 721 ms       |
| 50  | 150 |  19 / 41 ms   |     21 / 80 ms          |     0 / 0 ms          |   396 / 604 ms      |   453 / 633 ms       |

Reading the table:

- **`publishToPickup` p50 *drops* with load**, from 55 → 21ms. p95
  spikes at c=5/10 (740 / 406ms) but is dominated by move-0
  cold-wake (see breakdown above). At c=50 the p95 is back to 80ms
  because the broker loop never goes idle long enough to catch a
  cold wake-up.
- **`apply` p95 climbs cleanly** (8 → 45 ms = 5.6× at c=25, then
  41ms at c=50 — Postgres holds up). This is the only metric where
  load amplification is monotone and clean.
- **`pickupToWrite` is flat at 0** at every level — broker dispatch
  loop is not a bottleneck, which kills one Phase 5 sub-task ("audit
  redis pub/sub round-trip" — answer: it's fine).
- **`movePostAck` p50 ~doubles** by c=50 (166 → 396 ms), driven by
  apply growth + Node event-loop pressure. This is the dominant
  user-perceptible regression under load.
- **No fatal failures** at c=50 (50/50 users completed all 3 moves).

This rewrites Phase 5's ROI math and step list. The original
in-process-fanout / pubsub-shortcut steps below are still valid,
but the headline win is no longer "~300 ms saved on every move":
it's "~300 ms saved on the *first* move per fresh table, *only* on
quiet services."

- [x] **Time-trace one move end to end.** *(spike landed 2026-05-04 on
      `dev`)* — `backend/src/routes/realtime.js` POST `/rt/tables/:slug/move`
      emits `Server-Timing: lookup;dur=X, apply;dur=Y` (lookup = caller
      resolution + table findFirst; apply = applyMove + DB writes +
      Redis XADD). `backend/src/lib/sseBroker.js#dispatchEntry` injects
      `_t: { publishToPickupMs, pickupToWriteMs }` into the JSON payload
      of every SSE frame (publishMs derived from the Redis stream id
      `<ms>-<seq>`). `perf/perf-sse-rtt.js` parses both and reports six
      decomposition rows: server.lookup, server.apply, network (POST RTT
      − server), redis publish→pickup, broker pickup→write, network
      (ack→event − server). **Local sanity-check (n=10):** every leg
      ≤2ms; total matches client-measured `playerEventMs`. Staging +
      prod numbers TBD after promote — that's where the ~400ms lives.
- [x] **Keep the broker hot — kill the cold-wake penalty.** *(Shipped
      2026-05-05 in v1.4.0-alpha-4.3 — see Appendix Z.1.7.)* Reduced
      `XREAD_BLOCK_MS` from 30_000 → 1_000 in `backend/src/lib/sseBroker.js`.
      Validation on staging: cold first-move publishToPickup p50 dropped
      **382 → 39 ms** (−90%), p95 **740 → 126 ms** (−83%) at c=5. Warm-move
      latency unchanged. No alert threshold change needed — resourceCounters'
      90 s staleness window is well above 1 s. **Phase 5 ROI no longer
      includes this win** — remaining Phase 5 steps target the
      ~270 ms steady-state floor only.
- [ ] **Confirm SSE response is unbuffered.** Express + compression
      middleware can buffer SSE frames if not disabled per-route.
      Verify `Content-Encoding: identity` (or no-op compress) on
      `/api/v1/events/stream` — gzip would buffer the entire stream.
- [ ] **Disable Nagle's algorithm** on the SSE response socket
      (`socket.setNoDelay(true)`). On Node + Express this is rarely
      automatic; can shave 40ms per write.
- [ ] **Audit Redis pub/sub round-trip.** SSE channels go through
      Redis (per `useEventStream`). Time the publish→deliver gap on
      the same VM. If it's > 50ms, the pubsub topology needs work
      (sharding, in-process fanout for same-instance subscribers).
- [ ] **Same-instance shortcut.** If the publishing process and the
      SSE-serving process are the same Fly machine (true for our
      single-machine setup), skip Redis entirely and dispatch via
      in-memory event emitter. Redis only kicks in when machines
      need to fan out to subscribers on other VMs.
- [ ] **Coalesce duplicate events.** A single move can emit
      `state(moved)` + `lifecycle(...)` + journey progress; if these
      fire serially with their own SSE writes, latency multiplies.
      Pack into one frame where possible.
- [ ] Re-measure with `perf-sse-rtt.js`. Target: POST move → SSE
      event ≤ 200ms p50 staging, ≤ 250ms p50 prod.

### F5 — Phase 1 specifics from the visualizer (concrete byte targets)

Phase 1 gives directional sub-steps but no per-chunk byte budget. After
running `VISUALIZE=1 npx vite build` once and reading the output, set
hard targets for each chunk and fail CI on regression:

- [ ] `vendor-react`            ≤ 50 KB gz  (current ~82 KB — Preact compat eval)
- [ ] `vendor-charts` (`recharts`) ≤ 25 KB gz (post-uplot swap)
- [ ] `vendor-auth` (Better Auth + better-fetch + zod) ≤ 30 KB gz
- [ ] `main`                    ≤ 150 KB gz  (current 411 KB — biggest cut)
- [ ] Each lazy route chunk     ≤ 60 KB gz
- [ ] `game-xo`                  ≤ 30 KB gz
- [ ] Total first-paint JS      ≤ 250 KB gz on Home (current 490 KB)

If any chunk exceeds budget, the PR fails CI without a `perf-ok`
label. Re-bake budgets after Phase 1 lands.

### F6 — Optimistic move rendering (perceived-perf, NEW)

The 560–670ms POST → SSE round-trip is the ceiling on Phase 5; below
that ceiling the user still feels every move's latency unless the
client compensates. The existing Phase 12 ("animation budgets") does
not address this.

- [ ] **Render the player's move locally the instant the click
      lands.** Update the local board state, animate the mark, play
      sound — all before the POST returns. Reconcile when the SSE
      `state(moved)` event arrives.
- [ ] **Predict the bot's response.** For built-in minimax bots, the
      same minimax engine ships in the client bundle. After the
      player's move, run minimax locally to predict the bot's response,
      render it as a "ghost" preview after ~150ms, then reconcile
      with the real SSE event. If predictions match (they will most
      of the time for minimax), latency feels zero.
- [ ] **Disable click during reconciliation window.** Prevents
      double-tap from creating an inconsistent local state.
- [ ] **Visual cue if reconciliation rolls back.** A subtle shake +
      color flash when the local prediction was wrong (rare for
      built-in bots; meaningful for ML bots).

### F7 — Streaming + progressive rendering (perceived-perf, NEW)

The plan mentions "streaming responses for tournament detail" inside
Phase 9, but doesn't lay out the priority order or the rendering
strategy. Expand:

- [ ] **`TournamentDetailPage` priority cascade.** Render the page
      header (name, status, time) immediately from URL params or
      the list-cache. Then `<Suspense>` boundaries in this order:
      bracket → participant table → match history → coaching cards.
      Each `<Suspense>` resolves independently so the slowest segment
      doesn't block faster ones.
- [ ] **NDJSON / chunked transfer for large lists.** `GET
      /api/tournaments/:id` returns a single JSON body today. Switch
      to NDJSON: header chunk, then participant chunks, then match
      chunks. Parse and render incrementally on the client.
- [ ] **Stale-while-revalidate as the default for lists.** When the
      user navigates back to `/tournaments`, show the cached list
      *instantly* (we already had it in memory), then refresh in the
      background. Same pattern for `/leaderboard`, `/bots`.
- [ ] **Skeleton density matches content shape.** Cards with avatar
      circles, table rows with proportional column widths, bracket
      shapes that mirror the round-N layout. Misshapen skeletons
      cause layout flicker on resolve and read as worse than no
      skeleton at all.

### F8 — Open measurement gaps (2026-05-05)

After closing the authed-endpoint gap on 2026-05-05, the remaining
synthetic blind spots, ranked by likely-to-find-real-issues:

| # | Gap                              | What's missing                                                                                          | Why it matters                                                                                                                  | Effort |
|--:|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------:|
| 1 | **Cold-authed page-level perf**  | perf-v2 only does `cold-anon`. We have authed *endpoints* (p95) but not authed *pages* (Ready/FCP/LCP). | Phase 1c is scoped from endpoint math (200→143 ms p50). Actual cold-authed page Ready could be 300 ms slower than cold-anon for *all* signed-in users — we're guessing the win. | 1d     |
| 2 | **TournamentDetail page**        | Not in `perf-v2`'s route list. The 1900-line render path Phase 13 calls out.                            | Heaviest single surface, most-engaged users, completely unmeasured. Can't tell if Phase 1's lazy-load helps until we benchmark. | 1d     |
| 3 | **Live SSE under realistic load** *(closed)* | ~~`perf-sse-rtt` measures **one** move at a time, isolated.~~ Closed 2026-05-05 by `perf/perf-sse-load.js`. Findings rewrote Phase 5's scope — see §F4 above. tl;dr: fan-out load doesn't degrade `publishToPickup`; the 383 ms prod number is **cold-broker-wakeup** on the *first* move into a fresh table, and warm/under-load moves all complete in <60 ms p50. | closed |
| 4 | **Repeat-visit / warm cache** *(closed)* | ~~Only cold-anon context.~~ Closed 2026-05-05 by `perf-v2 --context=warm-anon`. Mobile median: Ready **2050 → 370ms (−82%)**, FCP **1424 → 136ms (−90%)**. JS bytes go from 495 KB → 0 (cached). The remaining 370ms warm Ready is parse + execute + index.html revalidation + initial data fetch. **Validates the user's intuition that Phase 1's revisit value is modest** — bytes are already cached on revisit; bundle splitting only chips at the parse residual. SW app shell + SWR data caching are higher-leverage levers for returning users. See §F11. | closed |
| 5 | **DB time as fraction of p95** *(closed)* | ~~Endpoint p95 is wall-clock — could be 90% DB or 10% DB.~~ Closed 2026-05-05 by F4 load test + F9 audit. DB itself is fast (apply <20ms p95 at c=50, queries 1-5ms each); pool was hypothesised as the bottleneck but F9.1 deploy showed **no measurable improvement** — the wall-clock ceiling lives in CPU/fsync, not DB or pool. Confirms Phase 2 (DB indexes) stays deferred — see §F9. | closed |
| 6 | **iOS Safari**                   | Moto G4 (Chromium emulation) is the only mobile signal.                                                 | iOS Safari has different scheduling, cache eviction, and SSE handling (6-conn limit per origin is a known footgun). Significant market segment, zero data. | 1d     |
| 7 | **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**| LCP is tracked, CLS is not.                                                                             | Hero swap, late-loading auth UI, modal reflows all *could* cause shift (budget ≤0.1 per Web Vitals). Probably fine but the not-knowing is itself the gap. | 0.5d   |

**Suggested cadence:** add one gap per sprint, in rank order. Don't
batch — each gap-closing PR is its own measurement → finding cycle.

**My recommendation for next gap to close** (after Phase 1 lands):
gap **#1 (cold-authed pages)**. It directly validates Phase 1c's
expected ROI, and we already have the `xo_perf` token plumbing from
the `um perfuser` CLI. Gap **#3 (SSE under load)** closed
2026-05-05 — see §F4 above for the full evidence and revised
Phase 5 scope.

What stays *out of scope* for the synthetic harness even now: cross-region
latency (not actionable from a single test runner), tab-throttling
behavior (browser-internal, hard to script), and battery / energy
profiling (not a perf-budget conversation). Those go to RUM /
production telemetry if they ever become a question.

### F9 — DB audit findings (2026-05-05)

Triggered by the F4 load test surfacing `apply p95` growth (8 → 45ms
at c=25, 5.6×) — the only metric where load amplification was clean
and monotone. Audit covers (a) the immediate `applyMove` regression,
(b) F8 gap #5 (DB time as fraction of p95), and (c) other DB risks
on hot paths.

#### F9.1 — Connection pool bumped 10 → 30 *(shipped 2026-05-05; no measurable gain at this load)*

`packages/db/src/index.js` constructs `new PrismaPg({ connectionString,
idleTimeoutMillis: 15_000, connectionTimeoutMillis: 10_000 })`. **No
`max` is set, so `pg.Pool` defaults to `max: 10`.** Confirmed by
constructing a fresh pool (`new pg.Pool({...}).options.max === 10`).

At c=50 concurrent moves on staging:

- 50 in-flight HTTP requests × 2 queries each (`findUnique` +
  `update`) = up to 100 query-acquisitions queueing on 10 slots.
- Postgres on Fly.io completes each PK lookup / PK update in
  ~1–5ms (well-indexed, JSONB writes included).
- Pool wait dominates. Math: 100 acquisitions / 10 slots × 5ms ≈
  50ms per move queue depth. Matches the observed p95 of 41–45ms
  vs c=1 baseline of 8ms (~33ms additional).

Fix: bump pool to `max: 25–30`. Postgres' default `max_connections`
on Fly Postgres is 100+ for small instances, and we have one
backend service plus tournament service competing — 30 per backend
machine is well within bounds.

```js
new PrismaPg({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 30,                     // up from default 10
  idleTimeoutMillis: 15_000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 10_000,
})
```

**Predicted win:** `apply p95` at c=25 drops from 45 ms to ~10–15 ms.
**Measured (2026-05-05 staging post-deploy v1.4.0-alpha-4.3):**

| Concurrency | apply p50 / p95 — before  | apply p50 / p95 — after | Δ p95     |
|------------:|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| c=1         | 7 / 8 ms                  | 11 / 21 ms              | mild +    |
| c=5         | 7 / 8 ms                  | 9 / 29 ms               | mild +    |
| c=10        | 7 / 18 ms                 | 10 / 28 ms              | flat      |
| c=25        | 15 / 45 ms                | 20 / 46 ms              | **flat**  |

**Pool was not the actual bottleneck.** Postgres queries each
return in 1–5 ms; with `max=10` the pool was rotating fast enough
that no significant queue accumulated. The pool bump is a free
hedge for higher concurrency (we'd hit the wall at c=100+ on the
old setting), but the headline 5.6× p95 growth comes from
elsewhere.

**Why pool wasn't actually the bottleneck** (math):

- Each `applyMove` does 2 Prisma calls (`findUnique` + `update`).
  Each takes 1-5ms on Postgres.
- At c=25 fully concurrent, peak query load = 50 in-flight.
- With max=10 and 5ms hold time, the pool services
  `10 × (1000ms / 5ms) = 2000 q/s` capacity.
- Test load: 25 users × ~2 q/move ÷ ~600ms/move = **~80 q/s**.
- We were at **4% of pool capacity** even with max=10.
  Connection acquisition was never queueing.

**Where the cost actually lives** (ranked by likelihood):

1. **Backend single shared vCPU** (`backend/fly.toml` — 1 cpu,
   shared). The strongest candidate. At c=25 Node multiplexes 25
   concurrent in-flight requests on one shared core (effectively
   ~20-30% of a vCPU under contention). All `await` resolutions,
   JSON encoding, Prisma client SQL generation, and Redis client
   work share that single thread. Wall-clock per call grows even
   while the DB itself stays fast. **F9.2 (VM bump to 2 dedicated)
   is the direct test.** Predicted apply p95 at c=25: 46 → 15-20ms.
2. **Postgres WAL fsync per-commit.** Default `synchronous_commit=on`
   requires fsync on COMMIT. Fly Postgres on shared storage:
   typically 5-15ms per fsync. At c=25 burst-write (25 COMMITs
   queued behind one fsync flush window), batching helps but
   first-in-batch waits up to a full window. Adds ~10-20ms p95
   under burst. Mitigation: `synchronous_commit=off` (durability
   loss — not acceptable) or batching across moves (architectural
   change — not worth it).
3. **JSONB write amplification.** `Table.previewState` is a 2-3 KB
   JSON blob, fully rewritten each move. Postgres serialises the
   blob into TOAST, computes the new heap row size, may rewrite
   the page. Per-update cost is small (~1-3ms) but stacks under
   write contention.
4. **Prisma client JS-layer overhead.** Even with available
   connections, Prisma generates SQL, sends, parses result on
   the same Node event loop. ~1-3ms per call wall-clock just in
   JS. Multiplied across 25 concurrent loops, contributes to (1).

**How to narrow it down — concrete next steps:**

- [x] **Granular Server-Timing inside applyMove.** *(Shipped
      v1.4.0-alpha-4.4 2026-05-05.)* `applyMove` returns
      `_t: { findMs, updateMs, postMs }`; realtime.js surfaces
      `apply.find / apply.update / apply.post` in Server-Timing.
      **Read on staging 2026-05-05** (full breakdown in Z.1.9):
      apply.find ≈ apply.update at every load level (5/12 vs 5/15
      at c=25, 6/19 vs 7/19 at c=50). apply.post stays ≤2ms p95
      everywhere. Verdict: read and write grow proportionally
      (rules out JSONB-only write contention as the dominant
      hypothesis); broker dispatch is not the contention. The
      remaining `movePostAck` growth (163 → 302 ms at c=1 → c=50)
      lives **outside applyMove** — points squarely at suspect 1
      (1 vCPU saturation in Express middleware + handler).
- [x] **Pool metrics**: surface `pg.Pool` `totalCount / idleCount /
      waitingCount` per request. *(Shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.4
      2026-05-05.)* `packages/db/src/index.js` constructs its own
      `pg.Pool` and passes it to `PrismaPg`; `getPoolStats()` reads
      counters synchronously; surfaced in Server-Timing. **Read on
      staging 2026-05-05:** `pool.waiting = 0` at c=1, 5, 10, 25,
      50. Peak `pool.total = 9` (max=30, ~30% capacity). Pool was
      definitively never the bottleneck — F9.1 retroactively
      confirmed as a no-op for perf.
- [ ] **Direct F9.2 test:** stand up a temporary `cpu_kind =
      "performance", cpus = 2` Fly machine, point staging traffic
      at it, re-run the load test. **Now the recommended next
      lever** — probe results above eliminated DB / pool / broker
      as suspects. Predicted impact: `movePostAck` p50 at c=50
      drops 302 → ~150-180 ms.
- [ ] **Node `--prof` under load** *(only if F9.2 underperforms).*
      CPU profile while `perf-sse-load --concurrency=25` runs.
      Look for hot stacks in Prisma serialisation or Express
      middleware. Defer until F9.2 has been tested — the probe
      data already implicates the event loop.

**Decision:** Pool fix stays in (defensive + no cost; would matter
at c=100+). Real fix is F9.2 — promoted from hypothesis to
recommended next lever based on probe evidence. Probe narrative:
Appendix Z.1.9. F9.1 validation numbers: Appendix Z.1.8.

#### F9.2 — VM sizing as the secondary ceiling

`backend/fly.toml`: 1 shared CPU, 512 MB RAM. Even with a larger
pool, a single shared vCPU caps how much concurrency the Node
event loop can sustain before `movePostAck` p50 climbs (already
166 → 396ms c=1 → c=50). Once F9.1 lands, re-measure: if
`movePostAck` is still 2× at c=50 with apply now flat, the
remaining cost is Node event-loop pressure on shared CPU.

Cheapest knob: `cpu_kind = "performance"` and/or `cpus = 2`.
Cost decision, not a code change. Track separately — not
shipped without explicit budget approval.

#### F9.3 — Closes F8 gap #5 (DB time as fraction of p95)

Server-Timing headers on the move POST already split out
`lookup` and `apply` — both under 20ms p95 even at c=50. So
for the realtime path, **DB time is a ~50% fraction of total
movePostAck** (15-20ms server / 30-40ms total minus network).
That means a Prisma rewrite or driver swap (Phase 5 driver step)
would cap out at saving ~20ms per move — not the dominant win.
Confirms Phase 2 (DB indexes) stays "deferred for lack of
evidence": apply p95 is already <50ms at c=25; no rewrite
needed before pool-tuning lands.

For non-realtime paths (page Ready, /me/* endpoints), the same
pattern likely holds — Postgres is fast, but pool wait under
concurrency turns wall-clock latency into queueing latency
that no index can fix.

#### F9.4 — Other DB risks (hot-path audit)

Findings ranked by likely impact:

| # | Concern                                                   | Status                | Action                                                     |
|--:|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **`pg.Pool max=10`** (covered in F9.1)                    | Bottleneck under load | Bump to 25–30                                              |
| 2 | `BaSession` has no `userId` index — only `token` indexed  | OK as-is              | Better Auth's hot path is `token` lookup, which is indexed. `userId`-by-session is admin-panel only — leave |
| 3 | `Move` has only `gameId` index                            | OK as-is              | `Move` is append-only; never queried by anything else      |
| 4 | `Game` indexes are good (outcome, endedAt, players)       | OK                    | Already covers leaderboard + history reads                 |
| 5 | `Table.previewState` is JSONB, full-blob update each move | Acceptable            | <5ms per write at staging size; no normalization needed    |
| 6 | `db.botSkill.findMany`, `db.user.findMany` — no `take`    | Bounded by WHERE      | Each has tight WHERE clauses (single botId, role filter)   |
| 7 | `db.log.findMany` paginates with `skip/take`              | Good                  | Already the right pattern                                  |

Net: only F9.1 is a real fix. The rest are non-issues, captured
here so we don't re-investigate them.

#### F9.5 — Recommended sequence *(updated 2026-05-05 post-validation)*

1. ~~Ship F9.1 (`max: 30`).~~ **Done** v1.4.0-alpha-4.3. No
   measurable gain on apply p95 at the load levels tested
   (c=1 to c=25). Kept as a defensive change for future c=100+ load.
2. ~~Ship F9 probes (granular apply Server-Timing + pool stats).~~
   **Done** v1.4.0-alpha-4.4. Probes pinpointed 1-shared-vCPU as
   the bottleneck and ruled out pool, broker dispatch, and JSONB
   write contention. Detail in Appendix Z.1.9.
3. **F9.2 (VM bump) — DEFERRED 2026-05-05 on cost grounds.**
   Probe-validated as the right lever (predicted: movePostAck p50
   c=50 drops 302 → ~150-180 ms), but performance-2x VMs add
   ~+$87/mo across staging + prod (staging ~$31, prod 2 mach ~$62
   vs current ~$5.82). Current c≤25 staging perf is acceptable
   (apply p95 26 ms, movePostAck p50 ~220 ms). Re-promote when
   prod telemetry shows sustained c≥25, or when Fly's pricing
   changes. The probes stay wired — when we re-test, the
   before/after will be clean.
4. Phase 2 (DB indexes) stays deferred — F9.3 confirms DB itself
   is fast (apply queries < 20 ms p95 even at c=50).

### F10 — Sign-in flow latency (2026-05-05)

Triggered by user perception that "Better Auth feels slow." The
existing `perf-backend-p95` measured *read* endpoints; sign-in is
the write path the user actually feels.

#### F10.1 — Measurement (extended `perf-backend-p95.js`)

Added a fourth measurement tier — auth-flow endpoints — gated on
`PERF_AUTH_EMAIL` + `PERF_AUTH_PASSWORD`. POST `/api/auth/sign-in/
email` is included with reduced request count (default 50, since
each sign-in writes a `BaSession` row).

**Staging 2026-05-05 (REQUESTS=100, AUTH_REQUESTS=50, c=5):**

| Endpoint                                | p50    | p95     | p99     | ok |
|-----------------------------------------|-------:|--------:|--------:|---:|
| GET /api/version                        |  53 ms | 188 ms  | 229 ms  | 99/100 |
| GET /api/auth/get-session (anon)        |  55 ms | 132 ms  | 142 ms  | 100/100 |
| GET /api/auth/get-session (authed)      |  51 ms | 119 ms  | 141 ms  | 100/100 |
| GET /api/v1/leaderboard?game=xo         |  53 ms | 101 ms  | 137 ms  | 100/100 |
| GET /api/tournaments                    |  67 ms | 205 ms  | 340 ms  | 100/100 |
| **POST /api/auth/sign-in/email**        | **793 ms** | **1537 ms** | **1659 ms** | 50/50 |

Compare to local (Mac, full CPU): sign-in p50 71 ms. Staging is
**~11× slower** — the same shared-1-vCPU contention amplification
profile we documented in §F9 / Z.1.9.

#### F10.2 — Spike: which hash library is in use?

`backend/src/lib/auth.js:24-48` overrides Better Auth's default
hash with a custom `hashPassword` / `verifyPassword` pair using
**`node:crypto.scrypt`** (native binding via libuv thread pool):

```js
const SCRYPT_PROD = { N: 16384, r: 16, p: 1 }   // 32 MB memory, ~16.7M ops
const SCRYPT_DEV  = { N: 4096,  r: 8,  p: 1 }   // 4 MB memory
const KEYLEN      = 64
password: { hash: hashPassword, verify: verifyPassword }
```

Better Auth's *default* is `@noble/hashes/scrypt` — pure JS, runs
on the V8 main thread. XO already swapped that out, so:

- ✅ Hash is on libuv's thread pool (4 threads default), not main
- ❌ Worker threads would NOT add value — work is already off-main
- ⚠️ `SCRYPT_PROD` is at OWASP 2024 minimum; cutting `r=16 → r=8`
  drops below the floor

#### F10.3 — Decision

Reframed lever ranking after the spike:

| # | Lever                                    | Verdict                                                        |
|--:|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | ~~Lower scrypt rounds~~                  | Already at OWASP minimum; not pursuing without security review |
| 2 | F9.2 (VM bump 1 → 2 dedicated CPUs)      | Right fix; deferred on cost                                    |
| 3 | ~~Worker threads~~                       | Dead — already on libuv pool                                   |
| 4 | **Async UX** (progressive sign-in feedback) | **The right move** — ~30 LOC in SignInModal                  |
| 5 | Rate limit                               | Protects backend, doesn't help user wait                       |

The actual sign-in latency (~800 ms p50) is fundamentally bound by
memory-hard scrypt × 1 shared vCPU. Without F9.2 or weakening the
hash, no plumbing change makes a single sign-in faster. The
remaining lever is **perceived-latency UX work**: progressive
spinner + helper text in SignInModal so the wait feels intentional
rather than stuck.

**SignInModal shipped 2026-05-05** in commit `954f353`: inline
spinner SVG + delayed helper text ("Verifying your password…",
"Creating your account…", "Sending reset link…") after 400 ms.
9/9 tests pass.

#### F10.4 — Other Better Auth surfaces (not yet reviewed)

Same scrypt-on-1-vCPU latency profile applies wherever the
backend hashes or verifies a password. Surfaces that *probably*
have the same dead-air UX gap, ranked by likely impact:

| Surface                                  | Backend wait        | Reviewed? | Priority |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|:---------:|:--------:|
| `landing/src/pages/SettingsPage.jsx` — change password | ~800 ms (verify + hash) | ❌ | medium |
| `landing/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.jsx` — submit new password | ~800 ms (hash) | ❌ | **high** — failure here looks like the reset flow is broken |
| `GoogleSignInButton` / `AppleSignInButton` — OAuth click→redirect | browser handles nav feedback | ❌ | low — probably fine |
| `EmailVerifyBanner` resend button         | ~50-100 ms (no hash) | ❌ | low — rarely used |
| `signOut` (AppLayout / ProfilePage / SupportPage) | ~50 ms (session invalidate) | ❌ | skip — fast enough |

Effort to apply the same spinner+helper pattern: ~10-20 min per
surface. Could extract `Spinner` + `useProgressHelper` into
`landing/src/lib/loadingFeedback.jsx` if we touch ≥2 more files.
Filed as Tier 1 perceived-perf follow-up.

### F11 — Warm-cache (returning-user) baseline (2026-05-05)

Closes F8 gap #4. The single most important measurement we never
had: what does a returning user actually experience? Every prior
benchmark in the trend was cold-anon — fresh browser context, no
cache. Returning-user perf was assumed but unmeasured.

#### F11.1 — Implementation

`perf-v2.js` gained a new `warm-anon` context. Same as `cold-anon`
except a single `browserContext` is reused across the route's runs
so the HTTP cache survives. Each route runs RUNS+1 hits and
discards the first (priming, cold) — p50/p95 reflect the warm-cache
reality of a user reloading or returning between deploys.

Throttling stays per-page via CDP, so the same network profile
applies to every visit including the priming hit. Commit
`12f1322`.

#### F11.2 — Findings (staging, 2026-05-05, n=5/route)

**Mobile (Moto G4 / 4G):**

| Route        | Cold Ready p50 | Warm Ready p50 |    Δ | Cold FCP | Warm FCP |    Δ |
|--------------|---------------:|---------------:|-----:|---------:|---------:|-----:|
| Home         |        1760 ms |     **357 ms** | −80% |   408 ms |  **68 ms** | −83% |
| Play         |        2062 ms |     **371 ms** | −82% |  1404 ms | **136 ms** | −90% |
| Leaderboard  |        2070 ms |     **365 ms** | −82% |  1424 ms | **132 ms** | −91% |
| Tournaments  |        2065 ms |     **349 ms** | −83% |  1420 ms | **140 ms** | −90% |
| Tables       |        2077 ms |     **428 ms** | −79% |  1448 ms | **148 ms** | −90% |
| Stats        |        2048 ms |     **431 ms** | −79% |  1404 ms | **188 ms** | −87% |
| **Median**   |    **~2050 ms**|    **~370 ms** | **−82%** | **~1424 ms** | **~136 ms** | **−90%** |

**Desktop:**

| Route        | Cold Ready p50 | Warm Ready p50 |    Δ |
|--------------|---------------:|---------------:|-----:|
| Home         |          878 ms |     **401 ms** | −54% |
| Play         |          849 ms |     **376 ms** | −56% |
| Leaderboard  |          811 ms |     **380 ms** | −53% |
| Tournaments  |          767 ms |     **313 ms** | −59% |
| Tables       |          883 ms |     **456 ms** | −48% |
| **Median**   |     **~840 ms** |    **~400 ms** | **−52%** |

**`PlayVsBot` is the outlier** — warm Ready stays ~1000ms even
with cache. The sequential-init chain (`getCommunityBot()` →
`/api/v1/rt/tables` POST → redirect) doesn't benefit from HTTP
asset caching. Filed as Phase 1b — already documented.

**JS bytes go from 495 KB cold → "—" warm** (Resource Timing
reports 0 transfer when assets are cache-served). Wire bytes on
revisit are essentially zero.

#### F11.3 — What's left in the warm 370ms (mobile) / 400ms (desktop)

After cache eliminates download + decode + most parse work, what
remains:

1. **`index.html` revalidation** — small (~5 KB) but still a RTT.
   Browser sends `If-None-Match`, server returns `304 Not Modified`
   or new HTML if we deployed. ~50-150ms on mobile 4G.
2. **Bundle parse + execute** — V8 has a bytecode cache but it's
   not always reused (different on tab restart, low-memory mobile).
   Even a re-parse of the cached bundle takes ~100-300ms on Moto G4.
   This is what Phase 1 (per-route splits) would chip at — by
   parsing only the route's slice, not the whole bundle.
3. **Initial data fetch** — `useOptimisticSession` calls
   `/api/session` on cold mount. Authed users add `users.sync` +
   page-specific endpoints. ~50-200ms before page is "ready" by
   our spinner-detached definition.
4. **Initial paint + LCP work** — laying out the (now-instant) hero,
   loading any uncached images, layout pass. Small (~30-50ms).

**Phase 1 would impact #2 only.** Best-case mobile warm Ready
after Phase 1: maybe ~250-300ms (vs ~370ms today). Real but
modest.

#### F11.4 — Roadmap revision

The user's intuition was correct: **for returning users, Phase 1
is a modest marginal win.** The headline returning-user levers,
ranked by impact:

1. **Service Worker app shell** (Phase 20) — eliminates even
   the index.html revalidation + provides offline. Repeat Ready
   approaches paint-only cost (~50-100ms). The single highest-
   leverage perceived-perf change in the plan for the engaged-user
   cohort. **Filed for Tier 1 promotion.**
2. **SWR data caching** + **hover-intent prefetch** — for data-
   heavy pages (Tables, Tournaments), even the 200ms data fetch
   becomes "instant render of stale + background revalidate."
   Combined with #1, returning-user pages feel native-fast.
3. **Phase 1 (bundle splits)** — modest revisit win (~370 → ~250ms
   mobile parse), still **the right call for first-time visitors**
   (cold-anon mobile FCP 1416 → ~700ms is the headline). Ships for
   that audience.

**Cohort-aware framing for Tier 0:**

- **First-time / cold-anon users:** Phase 1 wins. Phase 3 (image
  diet) ✅ + Phase 1d (instant hero) ✅ already help.
- **Returning users:** SW + SWR + hover-prefetch wins. Phase 1
  helps a little.

**We don't yet know the cohort split.** D1 RUM is shipped but we
haven't analyzed engaged-user vs new-user numbers. F11.5 below.

#### F11.5 — Cohort segmentation (instrumentation shipped)

**Shipped on dev 2026-05-05.** The instrumentation needed to answer
"which cohort dominates: first-time visitors or returning users?"
is in:

- **Schema:** `PerfVital.cohort` column + index
  (`20260505180000_perf_vitals_cohort` migration).
- **Client (`landing/src/lib/rum.js`):** `cohort()` reads
  `localStorage.aiarena_rum_first_seen` once per session. Empty →
  `'first-visit'` (and sets the flag); set → `'returning'`;
  localStorage unavailable → `'unknown'`.
- **Backend (`POST /api/v1/perf/vitals`):** validates against the
  `'first-visit' | 'returning' | 'unknown'` allow-list; invalid
  values stored as `null`.
- **Admin endpoint (`GET /api/v1/admin/health/perf/vitals`):** new
  `?cohort=` query param, plus `byCohort` row-counts and
  `cohortMetrics` (per-cohort × per-metric percentiles) in the
  response. The dashboard UI to render this is a follow-up; the
  data is queryable via the API today.

**The data only flows after /stage** (instrumentation has to reach
real users). Plan: stage v1.4.0-alpha-4.5, let RUM flow for at least
3-5 days of regular traffic, then read `byCohort` row counts to know
the split, and `cohortMetrics.first-visit.FCP.p75` vs
`cohortMetrics.returning.FCP.p75` for the cohort-Δ that drives the
sequencing call.

**Until then, sequencing is gut-feel.** Phase 1 and Phase 20 both
stay Tier 0; the cohort data will tell us which to ship first if
there isn't bandwidth for both at once.

Edge cases the cohort metric handles cleanly:

- **localStorage cleared / new browser / incognito** → looks like
  `'first-visit'` each session. Honest representation: those
  *are* cold-cache visits.
- **Deploy churn** → all hashed assets invalidate, but localStorage
  persists. So a returning user post-deploy reports `'returning'`
  even though their cache is functionally cold for the new bundle.
  Acceptable signal for our question (they *are* a returning user
  experiencing what returning users experience).
- **Multiple tabs same browser** → first tab marks the flag; second
  tab also reads `'returning'`. No double-counting first-visit.

## Appendix Z — Completed measurement work (archive)

This appendix collects detailed findings from completed instrumentation
and measurement passes. The summaries that *inform current decisions*
stay in the active sections above; the verbose detail and historical
tables live here so the working portion of the plan stays readable.

### Z.1 — Targeted gap measurements (2026-05-04 / 05)

The 0.1 baseline (2026-05-02) left four open questions. New scripts
plugged each one without waiting on RUM (0.2) or Prometheus (0.3):

- **`perf/perf-inp.js`** — INP per page via `PerformanceObserver({type:
  'event', durationThreshold: 16})`, 5 runs × desktop+mobile.
- **`perf/perf-sse-rtt.js`** — SSE connect, POST move ack, POST move →
  SSE state event, POST move → bot move event, 20 runs.
- **`perf/perf-backend-p95.js`** — concurrent loader, 200 reqs ×
  concurrency 5 across the five hot read endpoints.
- **`perf-v2.js --extended-resources`** — wait 5s post-Ready and
  re-collect resource bytes, exposing late-loading images that
  `transferSize` reports as 0 at Ready time.

Saved at `perf/baselines/{inp,sse-rtt,backend-p95,perf}-{env}-*.json`.

#### Z.1.1 — INP — the click-to-paint floor is excellent

Where the script could find a stable interaction, every measured route
sits **well under the 200ms "good" threshold** on both desktop and
Moto G4 mobile:

| Interaction              | Desktop p50 | Desktop p95 | Mobile p50 | Mobile p95 |
|--------------------------|------------:|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| Home — refresh demo      | **24ms**    | 120ms       | 24ms       | 32ms       |
| Home — open sign-in      | **32ms**    | 32ms        | 24ms       | 40ms       |
| Puzzles — first button   | **24ms**    | 24ms        | 24ms       | 24ms       |

Two routes (Tournaments filter, Leaderboard "Show bots" toggle) hit
selector-miss issues during the run; the data we have already says
**INP is not a problem on the platform today** for the routes that
landed. Phase 15 (Guide INP audit) drops in priority — the *idle*
floor is fine.

#### Z.1.2 — SSE round-trip — perceived-latency deep dive

Every PvP / PvB move passes through this path. Headline numbers from
the 2026-05-05 baseline (post Fly-Replay fix):

| Phase                       | Staging p50 | Staging p95 | Prod p50  | Prod p95   |
|-----------------------------|------------:|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
| SSE connect → session       | 194ms       | 258ms       | 179ms     | 263ms      |
| POST move → ack             | 173ms       | 233ms       | 185ms     | 252ms      |
| **POST move → SSE state**   | **656ms**   | 902ms       | **577ms** | 926ms      |
| POST move → bot move event  | 657ms       | 902ms       | 578ms     | 926ms      |

Three load-bearing facts that informed the Tier 0 ranking:

1. **The POST acks at 174–262ms but the SSE event arrives 386–408ms
   later.** That gap is the SSE pub/sub dispatch — flushing the
   channel write through to the same client's open EventSource.
   *This is the perceived-perf bottleneck on every move.*
2. **Bot move and player move arrive ~simultaneously** because the
   backend dispatches both state events in the same request handler.
3. **Prod is ~120ms slower than staging on the SSE round-trip.** Same
   machine class, same code. Likely cold-machine flap.

#### Z.1.3 — Multi-machine Fly-Replay fix (2026-05-04)

The prod baselines collected on 2026-05-04 surfaced a real production
bug, not a measurement artifact. The first prod run after the iad
migration showed **18/20 SSE round-trips failing** with
`409 SSE_SESSION_EXPIRED`; staging was 0/20.

Root cause: prod runs **2 backend machines** behind Fly's round-robin
load balancer. The SSE session registry is a per-process `Map` keyed
by session id, so any `/rt/*` POST that hit the *other* machine looked
up an unknown session and 409'd. Staging (1 machine) never tripped it.

Fix (commit `0771718`): SSE session ids are now minted with a
machine-id prefix (`<FLY_MACHINE_ID>.<nanoid>`). The `/rt/*`
middleware decodes the prefix and, if it doesn't match the current
machine, returns the `Fly-Replay` header to retry the request on the
owning machine. ~30 LOC primitive in
`backend/src/realtime/flyReplay.js` plus 2 call sites.

Post-fix prod baseline: **0/20 failures, 20/20 valid samples.** Code-
path overhead unchanged (`server.lookup` 4ms, `server.apply` 8ms).

**Baseline discontinuity:**
`perf/baselines/sse-rtt-prod-2026-05-04T23-53-58-761Z.json` and
earlier prod F4 baselines were computed over the 2 lucky runs that
landed on the SSE-owning machine — their p50/p95s look artificially
low. Use `perf/baselines/sse-rtt-prod-2026-05-05T01-17-08-425Z.json`
(the first post-fix run) as the new prod F4 reference.

A future Redis-backed session registry (which would replace
Fly-Replay entirely and enable non-Fly hosting) is captured in
`doc/Future_Ideas.md` and is deferred until non-Fly hosting is on
the table.

#### Z.1.4 — Prod re-baseline 2026-05-05 (full suite, post Fly-Replay)

`perf/perf-rebaseline.sh prod` ran all 7 scripts against
v1.4.0-alpha-4.0 in 555 s. **Headline takeaways:**

- **Backend latency, all green.** No endpoint p95 over 140ms; only
  flag is the Better Auth rate limit on synthetic `get-session`.
- **SSE 0/20 failures.** The Fly-Replay fix is doing its job in prod.
- **Cold-page Ready** — desktop p50 ~750–990 ms; mobile (Moto G4 / 4G)
  p50 in a tight ~2030–2080 ms band. Mobile dominated by JS parse
  (496 KB bundle) + the (then-) 888 KB hero image.
- **TBT** — desktop = 0 ms; mobile Home p50 = 99 ms (p95 121 ms). All
  TBT lives in mobile JS parse, not application code.
- **INP** — every measured interaction p50 ≤ 32 ms on both devices.

**Two items the new baselines re-confirmed as load-bearing** (now
Tier 0): the 888 KB hero image on every cold-anon page (Phase 3 —
shipped) and POST move → SSE state ~577 ms p50 prod (Phase 5 — open).

#### Z.1.5 — Backend endpoint p95 (2026-05-05)

| Endpoint                          | Stage p50 | Stage p95 | Stage p99 | Prod p50 | Prod p95 | Prod p99 |
|-----------------------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| `GET /api/version`                | 52ms      | 135ms     | 225ms     | 54ms     | 139ms    | 158ms    |
| `GET /api/v1/bots?gameId=xo`      | 72ms      | 184ms     | 305ms     | 68ms     | 140ms    | 157ms    |
| `GET /api/v1/leaderboard?game=xo` | 52ms      | 113ms     | 137ms     | 53ms     | 120ms    | 144ms    |
| `GET /api/auth/get-session`       | 57ms      | 139ms     | 147ms     | 57ms     | 135ms    | 206ms    |
| `GET /api/tournaments`            | 67ms      | 143ms     | 256ms     | 54ms     | 137ms    | 160ms    |

All endpoints 200/200 ok except prod `get-session` at 90/200 (Better
Auth's default rate limiter trips at concurrency 5; real users won't
hit it, the synthetic harness needs a whitelist — filed as a Tier 1
follow-up).

#### Z.1.6 — Hero image: candidates evaluated + shipped (Phase 3)

**Extended-resource capture** confirmed `colosseum-bg.jpg` was 909 KB
on every measured route, starting around 500–700ms (overlapping the
Ready window). Original perf-v2 polled `transferSize` while the
resource was still in flight (Resource Timing reports 0 until body
fully lands).

**Candidates evaluated 2026-05-05** (in `perf/hero-candidates/`):

| Candidate | Spec                              | Size  | vs original |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------:|------------:|
| Original  | 1920×1279 JPEG                    | 888KB |        —    |
| A         | 1600w WebP q70                    | 174KB |    **−80%** |
| B         | 1280w WebP q55 (browser scales)   |  94KB |    **−89%** |
| C         | 960w WebP q60 + sharpness 7 blur  |  64KB |    **−93%** |
| D         | 800w WebP q50 + sharpness 7 blur  |  47KB |    **−95%** |

Because the image renders at `--photo-opacity: 0.18` (light) /
`0.06` (dark), encode-time blur and aggressive downscale are
imperceptible — the eye sees a tinted wash, not a photograph.

**Shipped 2026-05-05** (commits `28b7aca` + `f14d052` /stage to staging
v1.4.0-alpha-4.1) — went with a 2-asset responsive setup via CSS
`@media (min-width: 768px)`:

| Tier   | File                       | Size | Spec                  |
|--------|----------------------------|-----:|-----------------------|
| Mobile | `colosseum-mobile.webp`    | 50KB | 800w q55 sharpness 7  |
| Tablet+| `colosseum-desktop.webp`   |174KB | 1600w q70             |

Original `colosseum-bg.jpg` (888 KB) kept in `/landing/public/` as a
silent fallback.

**Measured impact** (staging v1.4.0-alpha-4.1, 2026-05-05 baseline):

| Metric (Home, cold-anon)   | Before        | After (staging) | Delta      |
|----------------------------|--------------:|----------------:|-----------:|
| `img_kb` mobile            | 888 KB        | **50 KB**       | **−94%**   |
| `img_kb` desktop           | 888 KB        | **174 KB**      | **−80%**   |
| Mobile TBT p50             | 62 ms         | 50 ms           | −19%       |
| Mobile LCP p50             | 1816 ms       | 1792 ms         | −1%        |
| Mobile Ready p50           | 2052 ms       | 2041 ms         | −1%        |

Ready/LCP movement on mobile is small because mobile cold-anon is
JS-parse-bound on Moto G4 (Phase 1 territory); the WebP win lands
primarily on **bytes-over-the-wire** (~838 KB saved per cold mobile
visit on 4G).

#### Z.1.7 — Cold-broker XREAD fix (Phase 5.1, 2026-05-05)

**Hypothesis tested:** the 383 ms publishToPickup p50 we'd been
attributing to Redis fanout is actually broker process wake-up
cost on a quiet service — under load (broker constantly busy)
it should drop, on cold first-moves into a fresh table it should
spike.

**Evidence (`perf/perf-sse-load.js` 2026-05-05 staging, before fix):**

| c   | n   | publishToPickup p50/p95 | apply p50/p95 | movePostAck p50/p95 |
|----:|----:|:-----------------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1  |   3 |     55 / 196 ms         |   7 / 8 ms    |   166 / 197 ms      |
|  5  |  15 |     55 / **740 ms**     |   7 / 8 ms    |   189 / 260 ms      |
| 10  |  30 |     32 / 406 ms         |   7 / 18 ms   |   195 / 304 ms      |
| 25  |  75 |     25 / 406 ms         |  15 / 45 ms   |   291 / 556 ms      |
| 50  | 150 |     21 / 80 ms          |  19 / 41 ms   |   396 / 604 ms      |

The signature: cold first-move (move 0 of each game) p95 was
**740 ms at c=5 / 676 ms at c=25**, while warm moves (move 1+)
were < 70 ms regardless of load. At c=50 even move 0 was fast
(p95 106 ms) because the broker never goes idle.

**Diagnosis:** `backend/src/lib/sseBroker.js` used `XREAD BLOCK 30_000`.
When the backend is idle, the Node process pages out / scheduler
deprioritises it / Redis TCP recv buffer empty. The first XADD
that follows pays a 150–500 ms scheduling tax before
`Date.now()` is sampled in `dispatchEntry`.

**Fix:** `XREAD_BLOCK_MS = 30_000 → 1_000`. The broker loop now
iterates every second even when idle. resourceCounters' 90 s
staleness threshold is well above 1 s; no alert wiring change.
Code: `0dcb244`. Cost: ~30 idle XREAD/min vs 1; trivial.

**Validation (after deploy v1.4.0-alpha-4.3, sweep 1/5/10/25):**

| c   | publishToPickup p50/p95 — before | publishToPickup p50/p95 — after | p95 Δ      |
|----:|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
|  1  | 55 / 196 ms                      | 97 / 137 ms                     | **−30%**  |
|  5  | 55 / **740 ms**                  | 23 / **126 ms**                 | **−83%**  |
| 10  | 32 / 406 ms                      | 17 / 46 ms                      | **−89%**  |
| 25  | 25 / 406 ms                      | 31 / 77 ms                      | **−81%**  |

Cold-first-move at c=5: p50 **382 → 39 ms (−90%)**, p95 **740 →
126 ms (−83%)**. The wake-up tax is gone.

Single-stream `perf-sse-rtt` (n=20) confirms the same win on
the isolated path:

| Metric          | Before (2026-05-05 06:30 UTC) | After (post-deploy) | Δ      |
|-----------------|------------------------------:|--------------------:|--------|
| publishToPickup p50 | 526 ms                    | 113 ms              | −78%   |
| publishToPickup p95 | 635 ms                    | 191 ms              | −70%   |
| movePostAck p50     | 200 ms                    | 184 ms              | −8%    |

**Phase 5 ROI rewrite:** The "300 ms saved on every move" pitch
is downgraded to "300 ms saved on the first move per fresh table,
*only* on quiet services" — and that's now shipped. Remaining
Phase 5 steps target the ~270 ms steady-state floor only:
in-process fanout for same-instance subscribers, Nagle disable,
event coalescing.

#### Z.1.8 — DB connection pool fix (F9.1, 2026-05-05)

**Hypothesis tested:** the apply p95 5.6× growth at c=25 (8 → 45 ms)
was pg.Pool default `max=10` saturating under c=25 × 2 queries
per move = ~50 acquisitions on 10 slots.

**Fix:** `packages/db/src/index.js` — added `max: 30` to
`PrismaPg({...})`. Code: `3280859`.

**Validation (after deploy v1.4.0-alpha-4.3):**

| c   | apply p50 / p95 — before  | apply p50 / p95 — after | Δ p95       |
|----:|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
|  1  | 7 / 8 ms                  | 11 / 21 ms              | mild +      |
|  5  | 7 / 8 ms                  | 9 / 29 ms               | mild +      |
| 10  | 7 / 18 ms                 | 10 / 28 ms              | flat        |
| 25  | **15 / 45 ms**            | **20 / 46 ms**          | **flat**    |

**Result: no measurable improvement.** Pool was not the actual
bottleneck. Postgres queries each return in 1–5 ms; the pool of
10 was rotating fast enough that no significant queue accumulated
at c=25. The fix is kept in (free hedge for higher loads — would
matter at c=100+) but the headline cost lives elsewhere.

**Revised root-cause hypothesis** (untested, but two suspects):

1. **1 shared vCPU on the backend.** At c=25 the Node event loop
   contends with itself; Prisma serialization, Express middleware,
   JSON encode/decode all share one CPU. Manifests as wall-clock
   on every Prisma call. Addressable via F9.2 (VM bump).
2. **Postgres WAL fsync per-commit serialization.** 25 concurrent
   `Table.update` commits each fsync; Postgres serialises commit
   waits. Fundamental Postgres property; addressable only by
   `synchronous_commit=off` (durability cost) or batching.

Decision recorded in F9.5: F9.2 (VM bump) is the next lever,
pending budget approval.

#### Z.1.9 — F9 probe sweep: pool / apply-band evidence (2026-05-05)

**Hypothesis tested:** after F9.1's pool bump showed no apply p95
gain, three suspects remained — (1) 1 shared vCPU, (2) WAL fsync /
JSONB write contention, (3) broker dispatch + emit. The probes were
designed to discriminate.

**Probes shipped** (commit `7812210`, deployed v1.4.0-alpha-4.4):

- `applyMove` returns `_t: { findMs, updateMs, postMs }` — wraps
  `db.table.findUnique`, `db.table.update`, and the broker
  dispatch + io.emit + appendToStream tail respectively.
- `getPoolStats()` reads `pg.Pool` `totalCount / idleCount /
  waitingCount` synchronously; surfaced per-request in
  Server-Timing.

**Sweep on staging 2026-05-05** (`perf-sse-load --target=staging
--sweep=1,5,10,25,50 --moves=3 --ramp=80`):

| c   | apply p50/p95 | find p50/p95 | update p50/p95 | post p50/p95 | pool.total p50/p95 | pool.waiting |
|----:|:-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:------------------:|:------------:|
|  1  |    8 / 10     |    3 / 3     |    4 / 5       |   0 / 0      |       1 / 1        |   **0 / 0**  |
|  5  |    6 / 27     |    3 / 21    |    3 / 6       |   0 / 2      |       2 / 2        |   **0 / 0**  |
| 10  |    8 / 26     |    3 / 11    |    4 / 13      |   0 / 1      |       4 / 4        |   **0 / 0**  |
| 25  |   10 / 26     |    5 / 15    |    5 / 12      |   0 / 1      |       6 / 6        |   **0 / 0**  |
| 50  |   15 / 36     |    6 / 20    |    7 / 19      |   0 / 1      |       8 / 9        |   **0 / 0**  |

**Findings (verdict on each suspect):**

1. **Pool — RULED OUT.** `pool.waiting = 0` at every concurrency
   level. Peak `pool.total = 9` against a max of 30 — ~30%
   capacity. F9.1 retroactively confirmed as a no-op for perf
   (kept defensively for c≥100 future).
2. **JSONB write contention (WAL fsync) — WEAKER THAN EXPECTED.**
   `apply.update` p95 grows 5 → 19 ms across c=1 → c=50, but
   `apply.find` p95 grows the same way (3 → 20 ms) — and
   `apply.find` is a simple PK SELECT, no fsync, no WAL. Both
   bands track each other proportionally. If WAL fsync were the
   dominant contention, `update` would diverge sharply from
   `find`; it doesn't. Both are growing because they share the
   same Node event loop.
3. **Broker dispatch — RULED OUT.** `apply.post` p95 ≤ 2 ms at
   every level. The post tail (helpers import + io.emit + Redis
   XADD kick-off) is not a contention point. **Phase 5
   in-process fanout step can be deferred** with high confidence
   — it would save ≤ 2 ms per move.

**The remaining 290 ms** of `movePostAck` p50 growth (163 → 302 ms,
c=1 → c=50) lives **outside `applyMove`**: Express middleware,
auth, `lookupTableForCaller`, JSON parse, network. That growth
profile — wall-clock latency on every step that touches Node —
**is the 1-shared-vCPU saturation signature.** All concurrent
handlers share one core; under contention, every async resolution,
JSON encode, and middleware hop pays the queue.

**Roadmap impact:**

- **F9.2 (VM bump 1 shared → 2 dedicated) promoted from Tier 1
  to Tier 0 rank 2** as the recommended next perf lever, with
  hard probe data behind it.
- **Phase 5 remaining steady-state work demoted from Tier 0 to
  Tier 1** — the steps target ≤ 21 ms p50 of remaining publish
  hop; modest, and only worth it if F9.2 underwhelms.
- **Pool fix stays in** — defensive hedge for future c≥100 loads.
- **Phase 2 (DB indexes) stays deferred** — DB itself is fast;
  query growth is event-loop pressure, not query plans.

Headline win predicted from F9.2: `movePostAck` p50 at c=50 drops
302 → ~150-180 ms (validate by re-running the same sweep on a
2-CPU machine).

## Out of scope (and why)

| Option                         | Reason skipped                                                                |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SSR / Next.js**              | Major rewrite. Current SPA already hits FCP ~130ms; SSR's wins (LCP) are addressable cheaper via Phase 3 (image) + Phase 1 (bundle). Revisit only if mobile LCP > 700ms after Phases 1+3. |
| **CDN / Cloudflare in front of Fly** | Discussed in v1 — still ruled out for cost / ops; Fly's anycast already gets us most of the way. Revisit when international traffic is non-trivial. |
| **Redis / external cache**     | Same call as v1 — in-process cache + per-service warmth is enough. SSE pubsub already uses Redis. |
| **Drizzle / Prisma rewrite**   | Same call as v1 — query rewrite cost > expected gain. Phase 5 (driver) already in. |
| **Move ML training to backend** | Tracked separately in `doc/Connect4_Ship_Checklist.md` Spike B — perf is one input but architectural decision is broader. |
| **Tensorflow.js conversion**   | Same — `doc/Connect4_Ship_Checklist.md` Spike A. |

## Sequencing  *(updated 2026-05-02 from snapshot data)*

The original sequencing was a guess; the snapshot data lets us tier the
phases by expected impact. **Tier 0 must land before Tier 1 even gets a
benchmark slot** — otherwise the bundle floor masks any other win.

### Tier 0 — sorted by combined real + perceived benefit (2026-05-05)

Ranking criteria: **(1) ms saved per request × frequency × user reach
= total real impact**, **(2) user-visible delta on the click-to-feel
floor = perceived impact**. Sequencing constraints noted inline where
a later phase depends on an earlier one shipping first.

| Rank | Phase | Real ms benefit                                   | Perceived | Effort | Status |
|-----:|-------|---------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:------:|

|    — | 1d    | mobile FCP 1416→432ms (−69%), LCP 1792→432ms (−76%) | **huge**| 1d     | ✅ shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.2 |

|    — | F9.1  | pg.Pool max 10→30 — no measurable gain at c≤25 (free hedge for c≥100) | none | 1h | ✅ shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.3 (ineffective) |
|    1 | 1     | mobile FCP 1400→~700ms (−700ms × every cold visit)| **huge**  | 3-5d   | next   |
|    2 | 5     | remaining steady-state SSE work (~270ms floor)    | mid       | 3-5d   | sequenced after 1 |
|    3 | 1c    | cold-authed Ready 200→143ms p50 (−30%)            | mid       | 0.5d   | queued |
|    4 | 17    | locks Phase-1 gains; direct ms = 0                | meta      | 0.5d   | sequenced after 1 |

**Completed (this Tier 0 round):**

- ✅ **Phase 3** — Hero image diet. **Shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.1
  (2026-05-05).** Responsive WebP via CSS media query: 50 KB mobile
  / 174 KB desktop (−94/−80% from 888 KB JPG). Mobile TBT 62→50ms.
  Detail in Appendix Z.1.6.
- ✅ **Phase 1d** — Instant-ready hero. **Shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.2
  (2026-05-05)** in commit `d5cfabd`. Inline static board markup in
  `landing/index.html`; React `createRoot` swap on hydrate. Mobile
  FCP **1416→432 ms (−69%)**, LCP **1792→432 ms (−76%)**, desktop
  FCP **804→424 ms (−47%)**. Ready unchanged (bundle parse still
  dominates) but the *visible* "page is alive" moment now lands at
  the HTML-render boundary — biggest perceived-perf single move in
  the plan, delivered for 1 day's work.
- ✅ **Phase 5.1** — Cold-broker XREAD fix. **Shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.3
  (2026-05-05)** in commit `0dcb244`. Reduced `XREAD_BLOCK_MS` from
  30s → 1s in `backend/src/lib/sseBroker.js`. publishToPickup p95
  at c=5 **740 → 126 ms (−83%)**; cold first-move p50 **382 → 39 ms
  (−90%)**. Phase 5's headline ROI was this fix; remaining Phase 5
  steps target the ~270 ms steady-state floor only. Detail in
  Appendix Z.1.7.
- ⚠️ **F9.1** — pg.Pool max 10 → 30. **Shipped v1.4.0-alpha-4.3** in
  commit `3280859` but **had no measurable gain at c≤25**. Pool was
  not the actual bottleneck; queries are 1–5 ms each and the pool
  was rotating fast enough to never queue. Kept in as a free hedge
  for c≥100. Real apply p95 ceiling is elsewhere (1 shared vCPU
  + WAL fsync are leading suspects — see §F9). Detail in Appendix
  Z.1.8.

**Active queue (sorted by combined real + perceived benefit):**

1. **Phase 1** — Bundle audit + per-route splitting. **The single
   biggest remaining Tier 0 lever** — affects every cold visitor on
   every page. Concrete sub-steps come from the visualizer; expected
   to drop `main` from 411 KB gz to ≤ 200 KB gz and mobile FCP from
   ~1400 ms to ~700 ms (mobile Ready is a flat ~2050 ms band — JS parse
   dominates). Real benefit ≈ 700 ms × every cold-anon and cold-authed
   visit; perceived benefit huge (FCP is the most visible user metric).

2. **Phase 5** — Remaining steady-state SSE work. *Scope narrowed
   after Phase 5.1 shipped.* Cold-wake spike eliminated; remaining
   floor is ~270 ms p50 of which `publishToPickup` is now 113 ms p50
   / 191 ms p95 (single-stream, post-fix). Cutting it further means
   moving pub/sub closer (Redis on Fly proper, in-region replica) or
   collapsing the event hop entirely (write directly to the
   originating connection's response, skipping pub/sub for the
   single-machine fast path). Concrete steps in §F4: SSE-unbuffered
   confirm, Nagle disable, in-process fanout, event coalesce.
   **Sequenced after Phase 1** — re-measure first; bundle work likely
   shrinks the perceived gap.

3. **Phase 1c** — Cold-authed orchestration cleanup. Memoize
   `api.users.sync` with a per-token in-flight `Map<token,Promise>`
   so the two parallel effects in `AppLayout.jsx` (`:288` and `:439`)
   share one round-trip. Critical path drops from ~200 ms p50 / 262 ms
   p95 to ~143 ms p50 / 205 ms p95 — a **30% cut on every cold-authed
   first paint**. ~30 LOC. Half-day. *Could land in parallel with
   Phase 1.*

4. **Phase 17** — CI bundle-size guard. Fail PR on > 5% chunk growth.
   *Sequenced after Phase 1.* Direct ms = 0; meta-value high (locks
   in Phase 1's gains so future feature work doesn't re-bloat them).
   Half-day to wire.

(**Phase 1b — PlayVsBot deep-dive** dropped from Tier 0 on
2026-05-05. The latest baseline shows PlayVsBot Ready at 991 ms desktop
/ 2058 ms mobile — same band as every other route. The "uniquely slow"
rationale is gone. Moved to Tier 2; will be re-promoted only if
post-Phase-1 measurements show PlayVsBot specifically lagging.)

#### Measurement gaps to close before declaring Tier 0 "done"

Today we baseline cold-anon synthetic only. Before claiming the Tier 0
floor is real, two gaps need to close:

- ✅ **Authenticated-route p95** — *Measured 2026-05-05 staging.*
  Wired via `um perfuser` (CLI command that creates a synthetic test
  user and mints a Better Auth JWT) + `PERF_AUTH_TOKEN` in
  `perf-backend-p95.js`. **All 6 authed endpoints under the 200 ms
  p95 budget**: `/users/me/roles` 142ms, `/notifications` 119ms,
  `/preferences` 137ms, `/hints` 127ms, `/bots/mine` 157ms,
  `/guide/preferences` 135ms. Authed dispatch adds ~10ms p50 over
  anon — negligible.

  **Client orchestration audit (2026-05-05).** Reviewed the actual
  cold-authed critical path in `landing/src/components/layout/AppLayout.jsx`
  + `landing/src/store/guideStore.js`. The fan-out is *less wasteful
  than feared* (only 2-3 endpoints, not 6 — `/me/roles`,
  `/me/preferences`, `/bots/mine` are page-specific not on landing) but
  still has avoidable serialization:

  | # | Issue | Location | Impact (p50) |
  |---|-------|----------|--------------|
  | 1 | `api.users.sync` called **twice** in two parallel effects | `AppLayout.jsx:288` and `:439` | +70ms wasted RTT |
  | 2 | Effect 1 serializes sync → `guide/preferences` | `AppLayout.jsx:288→296` (`hydrate()`) | unavoidable (hydrate needs User row) |
  | 3 | Effect 2 serializes sync → `users/me/notifications` | `AppLayout.jsx:439→441` | could parallelize *if* sync is dedupe'd |
  | 4 | `api.users.sync` is not memoized — no in-flight promise share | `landing/src/lib/api.js:139` | ground-truth for #1 / #3 |

  **Critical path today:** max(effect 1, effect 2) ≈ **200 ms p50 / 262 ms p95**.
  - Effect 1: sync (70ms) → guide/prefs (64ms) = 134-205ms serial
  - Effect 2: sync (70ms) → notifications (73ms) = 143-262ms serial, runs in parallel to Effect 1.

  **With sync deduplication** (memoize the in-flight `users/sync`
  promise so both effects share one round-trip): critical path drops
  to ~143 ms p50 / ~205 ms p95 — a **~60 ms / 30% cut** on every
  cold-authed first paint. Single-PR fix in `landing/src/lib/api.js`
  (wrap `users.sync` in a per-token in-flight `Map<token,Promise>`
  pattern; clear the entry on settle so retries still work).

  Filed as **Phase 1c — cold-authed orchestration cleanup** in Tier 0
  (promoted from Tier 1 — cheap, can ship in parallel with Phase 1).
- **DB time as a fraction of endpoint p95** — Phase 2 is currently
  deferred for "lack of evidence", but endpoint p95 is wall-clock and
  could be 90% DB or 10% DB; we can't tell. Wire OpenTelemetry or
  pino-trace into the endpoint hot paths (Phase 0.3) to settle the
  Phase 2 stay-or-promote question definitively.

### Tier 1 — sorted by combined real + perceived benefit

After Tier 0, **re-run `perf-v2.js`** and re-measure. The remaining gap
between the new numbers and the budgets table determines what stays.
Sort below is best-current-estimate; promote / demote as the
post-Phase-1 numbers come in.

| Rank | Phase | Real ms benefit                                | Perceived | Effort |
|-----:|-------|------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|
|    1 | 13    | TournamentDetail render path + memoization     | mid       | 2-3d   |
|    2 | 7     | mobile critical-CSS, transform-only animations | mid       | 1-2d   |
|    3 | 8     | skeletons (pure perceived-perf — no real ms)   | high      | 1-2d   |
|    4 | F9.2  | VM CPU bump (1 shared → 2 dedicated) — apply p95 ceiling | low | $$ ops |
|    5 | aux   | Better Auth rate-limit whitelist (synthetic only) | none   | 0.5d   |

(Phase 1c promoted to Tier 0 on 2026-05-05 — the dedupe is cheap
enough to ship in parallel with Phase 1, no longer waits on it.)

1. **Phase 13 — Tournament page** is the heaviest single surface
   (1900-line render path). Phase 1 should already lazy-load it, but
   the page itself still needs Suspense splitting + memoization +
   pagination on the round/match lists. Affects only users on that
   route, but they're our most-engaged cohort.

2. **Phase 7 — Mobile-specific.** Mobile FCP is ~3× desktop today —
   parse cost on Moto G4 CPU. If Phase 1 doesn't bring it to budget on
   its own, critical-CSS extraction + transform-only animations are
   the next levers. Pairs with Phase 1; only ranks below 13 because
   it's a "mobile remainder" — needs Phase 1 to land first to know the
   actual residual.

3. **Phase 8 — Skeletons everywhere new** (TournamentDetailPage,
   TournamentsPage, BotProfilePage, ProfilePage). Pure perceived-perf
   pass — the actual route isn't faster, just feels faster while
   chunks load. Pairs with Phase 1's `<Suspense>` boundaries (the
   skeleton *is* the fallback). Real-ms impact = 0.

4. **F9.2 — VM CPU bump (1 shared → 2 dedicated).** Direct test of
   the leading hypothesis for why F9.1's pool fix didn't budge apply
   p95 at c=25. Predicted apply p95 c=25: 46 → 15-20ms. Budget call,
   not a code change — track separately. Validate with `perf-sse-load
   --concurrency=25,50` before/after.

5. **Better Auth rate-limit whitelist for synthetic.** `get-session`
   90/200 ok at concurrency 5 in prod. Real users won't hit this; the
   synthetic harness needs an exemption (allowlist by IP or signed
   header) so future perf runs aren't polluted by 429s. **Measurement
   hygiene only — no user-visible benefit.**

(Phase 0.2 RUM dropped from this list — D1 RUM beacon and admin Web
Vitals dashboards already shipped via `f6b7079` and `507f7f6`.)

### Quick wins — high leverage, can run alongside any tier

These don't need to wait for Tier 0 and don't conflict with later work.
Order by gut-feel impact:

- **Service Worker app shell** (Phase 20). Repeat-visit Ready ≈ 0ms.
  Highest-leverage perceived-perf change in the plan.
- **Speculation Rules API** (Section E1). Native Chromium prerender for
  same-origin links — zero JS, zero library, instant nav on every
  cold-anon Chromium visitor.
- **103 Early Hints** (Section E1). Preload critical chunks before
  TTFB. 50–150ms shaved off cold first paint, free with Fly support.
- **Critical CSS inlined into `<head>`** (Phase 7). Cheap mobile FCP
  win the platform never had.
- **Materialized view for the leaderboard** (Phase 2). Kills a hot DB
  path forever; simple Postgres feature.
- **WASM SIMD minimax** (Section E3). Bot move latency from ~30ms to
  ~1ms. Becomes load-bearing once Connect4 lands.
- **CSS `aspect-ratio` + BlurHash placeholders** (Section E1). Free
  CLS kill + perceived-instant images.
- **`content-visibility: auto`** on long off-screen sections (Phase 7,
  Phase 13). One CSS line per container; free render skip.
- **Brotli quality 11** (Section E1) + **Brotli at the edge** (Phase 1).
  Cumulative 15–25% smaller wire bytes for zero runtime cost.
- **Atomize Zustand stores** (Section E2). One pattern fix; large
  re-render cut on TournamentDetail under live SSE updates.
- **`scheduler.yield()` in heavy loops** (Section E1). Pulls INP under
  100ms on Moto G4 with no algorithmic change.
- **Variable fonts + `font-display: optional`** (Section E1). ~50%
  smaller font weight + never-blocking render.
- **Pre-warm caches on boot** (Phase 2). Built-in bots, puzzles, system
  config. The first user stops paying the miss.
- **Resource hints for OAuth providers** (Section E1). Sign-in feels
  ~200ms faster on cold visitors.

### Tier 2 — promote *only* when data shows them as a bottleneck

These were Tier 1 in the original draft but the snapshot doesn't
support attacking them yet. Promote to Tier 1 only when re-measurement
shows them on the critical path.

- **Phase 2** — DB index pass. Backend p95 confirmed healthy across
  five endpoints in the 2026-05-05 baseline (no endpoint p95 over
  140 ms). Until RED metrics show DB time > target on a real surface,
  this stays speculative.
- **Phase 4** — Cross-service network shape. Needs measurement before
  it earns a slot.
- **Phase 6** — Backend cold start. Now in iad with `auto_stop_machines`
  policy in place from `29542f7`. Needs cold-start measurement to
  decide whether the policy is worth the cost.
- **Phase 1b** — PlayVsBot deep-dive. *Demoted from Tier 0 on 2026-05-05.*
  Latest baseline shows PlayVsBot Ready at 991 ms desktop / 2058 ms
  mobile — within the same band as every other route. Re-promote only
  if post-Phase-1 numbers show PlayVsBot specifically lagging.

(Phase 5 was here in the 0.4 draft. Promoted to Tier 0 — see above.)

### Tier 3 — perceived-perf polish, after the floor moves

These look like wins on a fast platform but reading "Refreshing…" on a
2-second cold page just adds noise. Land after Tier 0 + Tier 1.

- Phase 9 (optimistic / streaming everywhere)
- Phase 10 (hover prefetch on tournament cards / bot rows)
- Phase 11 (route transition polish — view-transitions API)
- Phase 12 (in-game animation budgets)
- Phase 14 (Gym worker-thread inference + WASM)
- Phase 15 (Guide INP audit)
- Phase 16 (Tables-as-primitive overhead)
- Phase 18 (production perf dashboard) — wait for RUM data first.

### Tier 4 — architecture experiments (Phase 21 + Section E7)

These are re-architectures, not phases. Pursue only if Tier 0 + Tier 1
+ Tier 2 + Tier 3 data still shows the gap they would close.

- **Bun runtime for backend + tournament** (E7). Collapses Phase 6
  cold-start entirely; ~30% throughput gain; biggest single win in
  this tier.
- **Hono on the edge for read paths** (Phase 21 / E7). Promote first
  if Bun runs into compatibility issues.
- **WebTransport replacing SSE** (E4). Lower latency + better mobile
  connection migration. Big lift; only after RUM data.
- **WebRTC peer-to-peer for PvP** (E4). Move latency drops to one
  same-network round-trip once tables are seated. PvP-only payoff.
- **Cloudflare Durable Objects for tablePresence** (E7). Frees
  backend to scale horizontally.
- **SSR / RSC for `/`** (Phase 21). Cheaper alternatives in Tier 0/1
  may close the gap first.
- **Edge functions for hot reads** (Phase 21). Subsumed by Edge KV
  in E4 if that lands first.
- **gRPC-Web on hot endpoints** (Phase 21 / E7). Revisit after Bun.
- **Self-rolled JWT replacing Better Auth** (E7). Only with
  measurement showing the auth library is the bottleneck.
- **Preact compat alias** (longshot from Phase 1).

### Re-measure cadence

- After Tier 0 lands → run `perf-v2.js --target=staging --warmup`
  and append a new `Performance_Snapshot_<date>.md`.
- After each Tier 1 phase → same.
- Tier 2 phases require Phase 0.3 RED metrics to be in place first.

Let the data drive every promotion. If a phase lands and the next
snapshot doesn't show movement, the phase is *landed but ineffective*
and the assumption gets revisited.
